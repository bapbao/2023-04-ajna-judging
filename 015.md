# using _mint() in PositionManager.sol can mint NFTs to a contract that cannot handle NFTs.

## Summary
if the `recipient_` is a contract using _mint() instead of _safeMint() can mint NFTS to a contract that cannot handle NFTS

## Vulnerability Detail
PositionManager.mint() uses _mint() to mint NFTS to the `recipient_`
```solidity

        _mint(recipient_, tokenId_);//@audit-info this can mint NFT to a contract that cannot handle nfts.

```
So since the `recipient_` can be both an EOA and a contract / proxy, if its a contract that cannot handle NFTS using _safeMInt() instead of _mint() would have been able to stop it.

## Impact
PositionManager.mint()  might mint NFTs to a contract that cannot handle NFTs.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Use _safeMint() instead of _mint() because it checks and ensures that NFTs are only minted to contracts that can handle NFTS.
