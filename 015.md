# XO-`flashLoan()` function does not check `borrower` balance

## Summary
- The `flashLoan()` function  does not check if the borrower has enough tokens to repay the loan. This means that an attacker could borrow liquidity from the pool and then fail to repay the loan, which would result in the attacker getting the tokens for free.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  */
    function flashLoan(
        IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver_,
        address token_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external virtual override nonReentrant returns (bool success_) {
        if (!_isFlashloanSupported(token_)) revert FlashloanUnavailableForToken();

        IERC20 tokenContract = IERC20(token_);

        uint256 initialBalance = tokenContract.balanceOf(address(this));

        tokenContract.safeTransfer(
            address(receiver_),
            amount_
        );

        if (receiver_.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, token_, amount_, 0, data_) != 
            keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan")) revert FlashloanCallbackFailed();

        tokenContract.safeTransferFrom(
            address(receiver_),
            address(this),
            amount_
        );

        if (tokenContract.balanceOf(address(this)) != initialBalance) revert FlashloanIncorrectBalance();

        success_ = true;

        emit Flashloan(address(receiver_), token_, amount_);
    }

```
- the `FlashloanablePool` contract has a vulnerability in the `flashLoan()` function, which is used to borrow liquidity from the pool. The problem is that the function does not check if the borrower has enough tokens to repay the loan. This means that an attacker could borrow liquidity from the pool and then fail to repay the loan, which would result in the attacker getting the tokens for free.
## Impact
- an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and lead to getting the tokens for free.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  check if the borrower has enough tokens to repay the loan. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the vulnerability.
