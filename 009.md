# in drawDebt() function borrower is always charged less than his debt due to precision loss because _roundToScale() divides before multiplying

## Summary
The problem is in the _roundToScale() function where division is done before multiplication.
```solidity
 function _roundToScale(
        uint256 amount_,
        uint256 tokenScale_
    ) pure returns (uint256 scaledAmount_) {
        scaledAmount_ = (amount_ / tokenScale_) * tokenScale_;
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
in the drawDebt() function there is a check to  ensure the borrower is not charged for additional debt that they did not receive, by making an external call to _roundToScale() function to calculate the `amountToBorrow_` with `poolState.quoteTokenScale`
```solidity
 // ensure the borrower is not charged for additional debt that they did not receive
        amountToBorrow_     = _roundToScale(amountToBorrow_, poolState.quoteTokenScale);//@audit-info _roundToScale() divs before mul
```

BUT, the _roundToScale()  function when performing the calculation, divides before multiplying which will cause precision loss.

This is a more vivid explanation: 

QUOTE_SCALE = 61,  So lets say `poolState.quoteTokenScale` is 61 and `amountToBorrow_` is 500.

This ` amountToBorrow_     = _roundToScale(amountToBorrow_, poolState.quoteTokenScale);`  will do  `(500 /61 )` which is `8.196721311475409` then multiply it by 61 = 500 according to this formular in normal maths ` scaledAmount_ = (amount_ / tokenScale_) * tokenScale_;`. so here `amountToBorrow_ `= 500

But, due to the fact that Solidity truncates the result of division we won't have `8.196721311475409` when _roundToScale()  does `(500 /61 )` , what we'll have is just `8` and when dividing by 61 what we have is 488 instead 500.


## Impact
borrower is charged less than his debt in drawDebt() function due to precision loss because _roundToScale() divides before multiplying

## Recommendation
Don't divide before multiplying in the  _roundToScale() function
And also look for another way to scale tokens with decimals <18
