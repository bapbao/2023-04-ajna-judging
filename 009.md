# `collateralAmountToPull_`  will always be smaller than users inputted collateralAmountToPull_ due to precision loss in _roundToScale() function

## Summary
dividing before multiplying causes precision loss in solidity

## Vulnerability Detail
in the repayDebt() function users inputted `collateralAmountToPull_` is updated with _roundToScale() result 

_roundToScale() does some calculation with users inputted `collateralAmountToPull_` and COLLATERAL_SCALE which is 93 but the issue is that it divides before multiplying causing precision loss 
```solidity
function _roundToScale(
        uint256 amount_,//audit-info this is `collateralAmountToPull_` 
        uint256 tokenScale_//@audit-info this is COLLATERAL_SCALE which is 93
    ) pure returns (uint256 scaledAmount_) {
        scaledAmount_ = (amount_ / tokenScale_) * tokenScale_;
    }

```
So lets say user inputs 1000.000000(the extra decimal places represent the token decimal, this one is 6 for USDC) as `collateralAmountToPull_`, when this line `collateralAmountToPull_  = _roundToScale(collateralAmountToPull_,     _getArgUint256(COLLATERAL_SCALE));` is executed, it will reduce the 1000.000000 inputted to 930 because of precision loss.

Solidity truncates values during division.
## Impact
`repayDebt()` function will always update `collateralAmountToPull_` to something less than what user inputted every time. 
User will always reduce less amount of collateral than what he inputted when executing the repayDebt() function.

## Recommendation
don't divide before multiplying in the _roundToScale() function.
And also look for another way to scale tokens with decimals <18
