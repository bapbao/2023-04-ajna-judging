# `Pool.addQuoteToken` rounding issue that can be used by a malicious user to round in the user's favor

## Summary

When a lender is adding quote tokens via `Pool.addQuoteToken()`, `LenderActions.addQuoteToken()` is called, where the `addedAmount` can be potentially rouned in favor of the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

When adding quote tokens, `amount_` is a param of the `Pool.addQuoteToken` function, chosen by the lender.

The `amount_` param is then passed to the `LenderActions.addQuoteToken` function (line 163):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L158-L163

`LenderActions.addQuoteToken()` is then assigning the amount to `addedAmount`:

Then if the deposit is below the LUP, the `addedAmount` is adjusted by using the `Maths.wmul` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L176

The `Maths.wmul` function is either rounding up or rounding down to the nearest `WAD = 10**18`, sometimes in favor of the protocol and sometimes against the protocol.

If the `Maths.wmul` function is rounding up and assigning the result to `addedAmount`, this is not in favor of the protocol but in favor of the user. Because `addedAmount` is then used to determine the users `bucketLP_`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L179-L183

The received amount of lp for the user can potentially be rounded up and the rounding can be in favor of the user.

Important note: Since the user can choose the `addedAmount` as shown above, they can influence the rounding that happens inside `Maths.wmul()` to make sure that the protocol will favor them by rounding up their lps.

Another note: Inside `Pool.addQuoteToken` the function `_roundToScale` is called that rounds the `amount_` param to token precision. But `poolState.quoteTokenScale` is very likely to be smaller than `WAD`, which means that the rounding does not counter the `Maths.wmul` rounding.

## Impact

When adding quote tokens, a lender can add an `amount_` of their choice, so that the protocol is rounding in favor of the lender. This can be exploited.

## Recommendation

Make sure that `LenderActions.addQuoteToken()` doesn't round the `addedAmount` in favor of the user.
