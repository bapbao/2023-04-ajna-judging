# ERC721Pool.sol doesn't implement onERC721Received()

## Summary

ERC721Pool.sol that manages user's collateral doesn't have the function to actually receive tokenId

## Vulnerability Detail

When we transfer tokenId to the contract, it should implement the function onERC721Received() to receive it as it doesn't use it by default (only EOA doesn't need it). And if there is no, any tokenIds sent will be stuck and lost.

## Impact

High. Any tokenId that is sent to the pool will be lost.
