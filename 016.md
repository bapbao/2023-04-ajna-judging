# use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() in _transferNFT,  NFTs could be locked if the receiver is a contract and doesn't implement onERC721 received

## Summary
safeTransferFrom() should be used instead of transferFrom()
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  IERC721Token(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).transferFrom(from_, to_, tokenId_);
```
using  transferFrom() for NFTs can have the NFTs locked if the receiver is a contract and doesn't implement onERC721 received.

## Impact
NFTs will be locked if the receiver is a contract that doesn't implement onERC721 received
