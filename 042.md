# User can vote a dust amount to pass proposal as long as the voting power is positive and steal fund from the GrantFund contract

## Summary

User can vote a dust amount to pass proposal as long as the voting power is positive and steal fund from the GrantFund contract

## Vulnerability Detail

Attacker can monitor the grand proposals distribution and routinely steal each low activity period remainder by submitting a transfer to self proposal and voting a dust amount for it.

Since the criteria for the final slate update is that any increase in total funding votes casted is enough, the attacker's costs are negligible, while the remainder funds during some periods can be substantial enough for the attacker to setup such a monitoring. I.e. as funds are constant share of the treasury, while activity can differ drastically, a situation when there are less viable proposals then funds can routinely happen over time.

The assumption of the current logic is that such unallocated funds will be returned to the treasury, but it will not be the case as the cost of stealing such funds is close to zero.

Schematic POC:

1. Bob monitors the end of each screening period and, whenever it is cheap enough, submits a proposal to send the remainder funds to self via propose

2. Bob votes for it with a dust amount of screenVote() and then fundingVote() with the dust votes he have. Since it is low activity period there are room, and it is included to _topTenProposals

3. Bob updates the top slate with updateSlate(), repeating current top slate with his proposal added. Since other proposals cumulatively do not allocate full budget and Bob's proposal have positive funding vote attached, it is included to the slate

This way Bob obtained the remainder funds nearly for free.

Core issue here looks to be the absence of the proposal votes threshold, which allows an attacker to claim the remained without any barrier to entry, i.e. having at hand only dust amount of governance tokens.

```solidity
    function _validateSlate(
        uint24 distributionId_,
        uint256 endBlock,
        uint256 distributionPeriodFundsAvailable_,
        uint256[] calldata proposalIds_,
        uint256 numProposalsInSlate_
    ) internal view returns (uint256 sum_) {
        // check that the function is being called within the challenge period,
        // and that there is a proposal in the slate

        // @audit
        if (
            block.number > endBlock ||
            block.number < _getChallengeStageStartBlock(endBlock) ||
            numProposalsInSlate_ == 0
        ) {
            revert InvalidProposalSlate();
        }

        // check that the slate has no duplicates
        if (_hasDuplicates(proposalIds_)) revert InvalidProposalSlate();

        uint256 gbc = distributionPeriodFundsAvailable_;
        uint256 totalTokensRequested = 0;

        // check each proposal in the slate is valid
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numProposalsInSlate_; ) {
            Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalIds_[i]];

            // check if Proposal is in the topTenProposals list
            if (
                _findProposalIndex(proposalIds_[i], _topTenProposals[distributionId_]) == -1
            ) revert InvalidProposalSlate();

            // account for fundingVotesReceived possibly being negative
            // block proposals that recieve no positive funding votes from entering a finalized slate
            if (proposal.fundingVotesReceived <= 0) revert InvalidProposalSlate();
```

note the line of code check:

```solidity
// account for fundingVotesReceived possibly being negative
	// block proposals that recieve no positive funding votes from entering a finalized slate
	if (proposal.fundingVotesReceived <= 0) revert InvalidProposalSlate();
```

the code only block all proposal that receive negative vote

consider there are 10 proposal,

9 proposal of them and receiving large negative vote, -10000000000

1 proposal receive 0 vote or -100 vote count, the user can simply vote for 101 wei of voting power or even 1 wei of voting power to get the proposal the passed and the steal the AJNA token from the treasury

## Impact

User can vote a dust amount to pass proposal as long as the voting power is positive and steal fund from the GrantFund contract if no other people vote

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of checking

```solidity
if (proposal.fundingVotesReceived <= 0) revert InvalidProposalSlate();
```

check if the proposal check positive voting threshold

```solidity
if (proposal.fundingVotesReceived <= fundingVoteThreshold
```
