# `DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH`  will be less than 90 days on some chains

## Summary
blockTime can be shorter on some L2's. 

## Vulnerability Detail
like in optimism 1 block = 2 secs, Bsc 1 block = 3 secs, Avalanche doesn't even have a block time e.t.c

But in Storage.sol the distribution period is hardcoded in block.number equivalent to 90 days in real world..
```solidity
 uint48 internal constant DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH = 648_000; //@audit-info only feasible on mainnet
```

Here within the `startNewDistributionPeriod()` function there is a check to ensure that there isn't currently an active distribution period whenever `startNewDistributionPeriod()` function is called 
```solidity
// check that there isn't currently an active distribution period
        if (block.number <= currentDistributionEndBlock) revert DistributionPeriodStillActive();
```


This won't be effective on some chains because block.number is NOT a reliable source of timing information as it changes on various chains.

 `startNewDistributionPeriod()` function can be triggered by anyone before the end of 90 days thereby spoiling their original design of 4 distributions per year. 

## Impact
`DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH`  may be  < 90 days on some chains 

According to Ajna Team there are 4 distributions per year hence 90 days each, but since the hardcoded `DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH` can be < 90 days in some chains, `startNewDistributionPeriod()` function can be triggered by anyone before the end of 90 days thereby spoiling their original design of 4 distributions per year.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a role to handle calls to `startNewDistributionPeriod()` function and implement access control on the `startNewDistributionPeriod()` function
