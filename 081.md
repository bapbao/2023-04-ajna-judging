# XO-`getBucketStateStakeInfo` function get Incorrect `bucketId_` check

## Summary
- The `getBucketStateStakeInfo` function has a vulnerability that does not check if the bucket ID exists before returning any information so this can be exploit and can the attacker call the function with a bucket ID that does not exist, and the function would return incorrect information about the `LP` amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function getBucketStateStakeInfo(
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 bucketId_
    ) external view returns (uint256, uint256);

}
```
-The vulnerability is in the `getBucketStateStakeInfo` function it's returns the `LP` amount and the exchange rate for a given bucket and a given stake, at stake time, the function does not check if the bucket exists.  means that if an attacker calls the function with a bucket ID that does not exist, the function will return incorrect information.
## Impact
- the vulnerability can cause a material loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This can be fixing this problem :
```solidity
if (bucketId_ >= stakeInfo.snapshot.length) {
    // Bucket does not exist
    return (0, 0);
}
```
