# Invalid pool address will lead to transferring funds to an incorrect or non-existent pool

## Summary
The _updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim allows any address to call it and pass any pool address and index values. It assumes that the provided pool_ address is a valid Ajna pool by calling positionManager.isAjnaPool(pool_, subsetHash_) but it does not verify the validity of the pool_ address or the indexes_ values, which can lead to unauthorized access, incorrect calculation of rewards and loss of  funds

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious pool_ address or arbitrary index values to manipulate the calculation of rewards or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.


## Impact
A user providing an invalid pool address will lead to transferring funds to an incorrect or non-existent pool leading to loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The positionManager.isAjnaPool function is used to verify that the provided pool_ address is a valid Ajna pool. If it's not a valid pool, the function reverts with the NotAjnaPool error.
Before updating the bucket exchange rates, add a loop to iterate over the indexes_ array and verify that each index is within the valid range of bucket indexes for the specified pool. If an invalid index is found, the function reverts with the InvalidIndex error.
