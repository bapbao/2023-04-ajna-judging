# [High] Integer Overflow Vulnerability in _calculateAndClaimAllRewards Function #4

## Summary
The code snippet contains a vulnerability related to the possibility of integer overflow when adding rewards to the `rewardsEarned_` variable.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the line of code `rewardsEarned_ += _calculateAndClaimStakingRewards(tokenId_, epochToClaim_);,` if the `_calculateAndClaimStakingRewards` function returns a large value, it can cause an integer overflow. Integer overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that a variable can hold. In this case, the `rewardsEarned_` variable is of type `uint256`, which has a maximum value of `2^256 - 1`.

## Impact
Inaccurate rewards calculation: If an overflow occurs, the `rewardsEarned_` variable will wrap around, resulting in an incorrect rewards calculation. This can lead to miscalculations in the total rewards earned by stakeholders.
## Proof of Concept (PoC):
```solidity
function _calculateAndClaimStakingRewards(uint256 tokenId, uint256 epoch) internal returns (uint256) {
    // ... Function implementation

    // Return an extremely large value causing an overflow
    return 2**256;
}

function testFunction() external {
    uint256 rewardsEarned = 10;
    rewardsEarned += _calculateAndClaimStakingRewards(123, 5);

    // The rewardsEarned variable will overflow, resulting in an incorrect value
    // rewardsEarned will no longer represent the accurate rewards earned
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeMath or similar libraries: Utilize a library like SafeMath to perform arithmetic operations on unsigned integers. SafeMath provides functions that include checks to prevent overflow and underflow, ensuring arithmetic operations are performed safely.
