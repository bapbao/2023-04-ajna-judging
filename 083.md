# Actors will be unable to Exchange Quote Tokens for Collateral in ERC20Pool Auctions

## Summary
The current implementation of the [`TakerActions._take`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L200-L267) function restricts users from exchanging their quote tokens for collateral, limiting this functionality to only the ERC721 pool type. As a result, actors are unable to perform this exchange in ERC20Pool auctions.


## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the [`ERC20Pool.take`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L390-L429) function prevents actors from taking collateral from the auction in exchange for quote tokens, specifically for the ERC20 pool type. This function interacts with the [`TakerActions.take`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L200-L267) function, which performs various logic before internally calling the `_take` function. The `_take` function is responsible for the actual collateral take operation from the auction.

Ideally, the `_take` function should be designed to handle both the ERC721 and ERC20 pool types separately. However, the current implementation limits the functionality of `_take` to only the ERC721 pool type, making it inaccessible for the ERC20 pool type.

```solidity
        // for NFT take make sure the take flow and bond change calculation happens for the rounded collateral that can be taken
        if (params_.poolType == uint8(PoolType.ERC721)) {
            takeableCollateral = (takeableCollateral / 1e18) * 1e18;
        }


```

```solidity


        if (params_.poolType == uint8(PoolType.ERC721)) {
            // slither-disable-next-line divide-before-multiply
```

## Impact
Actors will be unable to exchange their quote token to a borrower's collateral token during an auction due to the [`ERC20Pool.take`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L390-L429) function not working as expected

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the [TakerActions._take](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L200-L267) function needs to be revised to support both pool types.
