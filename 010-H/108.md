# The kick function uses outdated LUP to update Interest State

## Summary
The ```kick function``` in ```Pool.sol``` updates interest rates etc. via the ```_updateInterestState``` function using the LUP from the ```KickResult``` struct. But unlike the other functions in ```Pool.sol``` that use ```_updateInterestState``` function, kick uses an outdated value of LUP for the calculations. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Every major function in Pool.sol calls ```PoolCommons.updateInterestState``` via the ```_updateInterestState``` function at the end of their logic to update the Interest Rates, EMA values, debt etc. The concern here is that in the kick function, the new LUP value needs to be passed on to the ```_updateInterestState``` function in order to use it to update EMA values etc. 
An example is ```Pool.sol : addQuoteToken => LenderActions.sol : addQuoteToken```. We can see at [LenderActions.sol#L205](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L205) that the LUP is recalculated if the deposit has changed the relevant dynamics of top buckets used for LUP. This newLUP is then passed on to the  ```_updateInterestState``` function at Pool.sol#L169. 

Similarly for the ```drawDebt functionality``` we can see that ```ERC20Pool : drawDebt => BorrowerActions.sol : drawDebt``` call flow leads to [BorrowerActions.sol#L217](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L217) where first poolDebt is updated and the new LUP is then calculated based on that. 

The concern here is that the kick function does update the pool Debt but does not recalculate the LUP considering the newly accrued debt (which in the case of kick is the 90 days of interest added to the kicked borrower's debt ), and passes on the old value of LUP based on unupdated LUP to the call to ```_updateInterestState``` function.

This ```_updateInterestState``` function called at [Pool.sol#L309](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L310) then uses this outdated LUP to calculate the ```lupt0Debt``` and update ```interestParams_.lupt0Debt``` with this wrong value. This leads to wrong calculations. See [PoolCommons.sol#L114](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L114) and [L204](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L204). Though like other functions, poolDebt has been updated at [Pool.sol#L293](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L294)

## Impact
Outdated value of LUP passed on to the ```_updateInterestState``` function leads to wrong values downstream. 

Also, this creates an inconsistency in poolDebt and corresponding LUP since this debt is 90 days of interest penalty on a kicked borrower(which means this is a permanent debt change).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recalculate the LUP in kick just like how its done in other functions mentioned. This will remove the accounting inconsistency between poolDebt and corresponding LUP as well as prevent wrong downstream calculations.
