# Borrowers can pull more collateral than they actually have

## Summary
It does not include any checks to ensure that the borrower has sufficient collateral to pull when executing the repayDebt function.
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could execute the repayDebt function with a large amount of debt to be repaid while having little or no collateral in the pool. This would allow them to reduce their debt without providing the necessary collateral, leading to an under-collateralized state for the borrower. 
## Impact
This lack of collateral check will lead to an inconsistency between the borrower's debt and collateral resulting in an under-collateralized position, where the borrower's debt exceeds the value of their collateral. This pose a serious risk to the lender or the pool, as there may not be enough collateral to cover the borrower's debt in the event of default or liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a condition to verify that the collateral amount to pull (collateralAmountToPull_) is not greater than the borrower's current collateral balance (borrower.collateral). If the condition is not met, revert with an error indicating insufficient collateral. Update the borrower's collateral balance after pulling collateral.
