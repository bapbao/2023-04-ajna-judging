# Flawed Logic in MemorializePositions Update Requires Full LP Balance Approval


## Summary

In response to an earlier vulnerability that permitted a lender to unfairly accrue higher rewards and usurp other lenders' LPs from the PositionManager, the Ajna protocol's development team enacted an update to the `memorializePositions` function. This modification, however, introduces a new requirement: the LP allowance must at least equal the LP balance. While effective in mitigating the previous issue, this requirement imposes a significant constraint on the protocol's operations. It dictates that lenders approve their entire LP balance for interacting with the protocol, advocating an "all or nothing" approach. This restraint potentially impedes partial stake commitments, thereby potentially inhibiting the protocol's integration and user adoption.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `memorializePositions` function [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L197-L255), now incorporates a check to confirm that the LP allowance is at least equivalent to the LP balance:

```diff
    function memorializePositions(
        ...
        LendersBucketLocalVars memory vars;
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; ) {
            ...
            vars.allowance = pool.lpAllowance(index, address(this), owner);

//@audit new check
+            if (vars.allowance < vars.lpBalance) revert AllowanceTooLow();
            ...
```

[PositionManager.sol#L227](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L227)

```solidity
            if (vars.allowance < vars.lpBalance) revert AllowanceTooLow();
```

This validation is executed after the invocation of [pool.lpAllowance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#LL908C1-L916C1), which retrieves the allowance the owner has granted to Position:

```solidity
            // check that specified allowance is at least equal to the lp balance
            vars.allowance = pool.lpAllowance(index, address(this), owner);

// Which calls the below
    function lpAllowance(
        ...
    ) external view override returns (uint256 allowance_) {
        allowance_ = _lpAllowances[owner_][spender_][index_];
    }
```

Note that while this mitigates the original vulnerability of a user exponentially increasing the value of their position by setting the allowance to be less than their total LP balance since LP balance is what is being used to update the position At [L240-241](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#LL240C1-L241C44)

```solidity
            // update token position LP
            position.lps += vars.lpBalance;
```

It now imposes a significant barrier to entry, as protocol now assumes that users would would always want to commit their full LP balance which is not the case as lenders may not always wish to commit their full LP balance to the protocol.

## Impact

The new requirement that lenders must approve their entire LP balance to interact with the protocol creates a significant barrier to entry and restricts the protocol's utility. Some users may not be willing to approve their entire balance, thereby preventing them from using this functionality of the protocol. This could significantly affect user adoption and the protocol's overall success.

## Code Snippet

This code can be found in [PositionManager.sol#L227](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L227) of the `memorializePositions()` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L197-L255).

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

A solution could be to deposit the smaller value between `vars.lpBalance` and `vars.allowance` in line 240, as shown:

```diff
position.lps += min(vars.lpBalance, vars.allowance);
```

This change can help maintain the protocol's security while enhancing usability and promoting broader protocol adoption as this mean that the allowance can be allowed to be lesser than the balance but at the same time a lender would not earn higher rewards unfairly and take other lender's LPs from PositionManager, since the minimum value between `allowance and lbBalance` is used.
Another thing to note is that in the attempted to solve previous bug a user could exponentially increase the value of their position by setting the allowance to be less than their total LP balance, and repeatedly calling the memorializePositions function, but by taking the minimum of `vars.lpBalance` and `vars.allowance`, we ensure that the amount of LPs transferred into the position can't exceed the specified allowance.
