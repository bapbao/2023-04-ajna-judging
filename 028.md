# totalDelegateRewards is less than the actual fraction of funds that should have been allocated

## Summary
totalDelegateRewards = (fundsAvailable / 10); calculates the total delegate rewards by dividing fundsAvailable by 10. If fundsAvailable is not divisible by 10, the result will be rounded down to the nearest integer. The fractional part of the division will be truncated, and the missing funds will not be allocated as rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
If fundsAvailable is 105 divided by 10, the quotient is 10.5. In Solidity, the result will be rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 10. Therefore, the value of totalDelegateRewards will be 10.
As a consequence of this rounding down, there will be a loss of funds. The totalDelegateRewards will be less than the actual fraction of funds that should have been allocated. The remaining fraction, in this case, 0.5, will not be allocated to delegate rewards and will be retained in the treasury variable.
The remaining funds in the treasury variable are added to the fundsAvailable (excluding totalTokenDistributed and totalDelegateRewards). However, since the totalDelegateRewards calculation rounded down the result, the actual funds that should have been allocated to delegate rewards are not considered in the treasury update. This discrepancy results in loss of funds.
## Impact
FundsAvailable is not divisible by 10, the division operation will round down the result leading to  loss of funds in the calculation of totalDelegateRewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the SafeMath.divCeil function from the SafeMath library (OpenZeppelin) to perform the division with rounding up. This ensures that any remaining funds after distributing to proposals and subtracting delegate rewards are not lost in the calculation.
