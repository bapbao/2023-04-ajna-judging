# Removing collateral can be exploited due to rounding issues in `Buckets.collateralToLP()`

## Summary

When the `Buckets.collateralToLP` function is called, there can be rounding issues due to the fact that the `rounding_` param is being ignored in certain cases. This can be exploited by users when removing collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `Buckets.collateralToLP` function is called, there are 2 cases where the `rounding_` param is ignored, which is used to round in favor of the protocol. But since the `rounding_` param is ignored, rounding in favor of the user can occur.

Case 1: When there's no deposit nor collateral in bucket the result of the function `Maths.wmul` is returned:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Buckets.sol#L120

The function `Maths.wmul` is rounding up or down to the nearest `WAD = 10**18`. The rounding can be in favor of or against the user, which is not good, because rounding should always be against the user and in favor of the protocol.

Case 2: When there's deposit or collateral in bucket but no LP to cover, the result of the function `Maths.wmul` is returned again similar to Case 1:

When removing collateral, the `lpAmount_` should be rounded up in favor of the protocol, but can be rounded down in favor of the user due to the issues described above inside `Buckets.collateralToLP()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L483

The same applies for the use case where the max amount of collateral is removed and the `requiredLP` should be rounded up in favor of the protocol, but can be rounded down in favor of the user due to the issues described above inside `Buckets.collateralToLP()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L674

Note that the user sets the `amount_` of collateral (LenderActions.sol line 467), which is then passed into `Buckets.collateralToLP()` (LenderActions.sol line 487) for the `collateral_` param (Buckets.sol line 115) which is used for the `Maths.wmul` calculations (Buckets.sol line 120, 123):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Buckets.sol#L115

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Buckets.sol#L120

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Buckets.sol#L123

That means that the user can control the rounding behaviour of `Maths.wmul` by selecting an appropriate amount of collateral to remove, so that the result of `Buckets.collateralToLP` is rounded down in favor of the user.

## Impact

The protocol is potentially rounding in favor of the user when removing collateral or when removing the max amount of collateral, which can be exploited.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the function `Buckets.collateralToLP` don't ignore the `rounding_` param.
