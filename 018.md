# Minting NFTs to contract address will fail(Missing issue in docs)

First of all before going deep in below report, I had a detail discussion with sponsors in discord private chat and the issue is confirmed with some agreed solution which is mentioned in recommendations and agreed for a fix by sponsors.

## Summary
Minting NFTs to contract address will fail. Use safeMint instead of mint for Minting NFTs to contract address.

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In PositionManager.mint(), If the recipient_ is the contract address which unable to receive ERC721 token or it does not implement the onERC721Received method, the NFT will be permanently locked or frozen in the contract which will happen in the current implementation mint( ) functions as shown below,

```solidity
File: src/PositionManager.sol

267    function mint(
268        address pool_,
269        address recipient_,
270        bytes32 poolSubsetHash_
271    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 tokenId_) {
272        // revert if the address is not a valid Ajna pool
273        if (!_isAjnaPool(pool_, poolSubsetHash_)) revert NotAjnaPool();
274
275        tokenId_ = _nextId++;
276
277        // record which pool the tokenId was minted in
278        positionTokens[tokenId_].pool = pool_;
279
280        _mint(recipient_, tokenId_);
281
282        emit Mint(recipient_, pool_, tokenId_);
283    }
```
_mint( ) function wonâ€™t check if the recipient is able to receive the NFT. If an incorrect address is passed, it will result in a silent failure and loss of asset.

As per ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin, Use of _mint() is discouraged, use _safeMint() whenever possible.

As per ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin, If `recipient` is a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}

**Discussion with Sponsors(@dizzy):**
I had a detail discussion on safeMint() along with safeTransferFrom()(already reported in another issue) usage instead of _mint() in mint() function at L-280. I explained the impact of not using _mint(() function which with current implementation will not be able to transfer the NFTs to contract address and lock the user NFTs.  It was also discussed the scenario after account abstraction will fully rollout where smart contracts will handle as account. While discussion, it was said the contracts will be used by some already deployed proxy contract. This proxy contract holds tokens. Inshort the contracts will used via. proxy contracts. Now the issue is the proxy contract does not implement the onERC721Received support which for sure wont be able to receive the NFTs and if the NFTs sent to contract address with NO onERC721Received support will lock or freeze the NFTs permanently. It also does not seems to be possible for redeployment of proxy contract to mitigate the issue. After all Pros and Cons, It was decided to go with current implementation only but these critical issues are NOT documented anywhere. These critical issue are not aware to users and integrators.

Please be noted Ajna 1st Sherlock contest had used safeMint() but later after discussion with integrators on purposely use of transferFrom() to allow integrators use their existing contracts / proxies., Now it has used mint().

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Use safeMint instead of mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation with reentrancy protection. But as per the detail discussion on this topic, this does not seems to be possible presently.
2) Make a clear documents stating above issues pertaining to MINTING of NFTs to contract addresses, also alert users the impact of MINTING the NFT to contract address at Front-end user interface(UI).
3) As discussed and agreed, Kindly mention these critical issues clearly in documentation for USERS as well as for INTEGRATORS to make sure their contracts support the NFT and they are not end up locked NFTs in their contracts.
