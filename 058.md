# Zero Access Control (High) #1

## Summary
The provided contract code has a vulnerability related to the movement of collateral from the pool to the address specified as the collateral receiver. There is no access control implemented, allowing anyone to call the function and specify any address as the collateral receiver.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `repayDebt` function in the contract allows the transfer of collateral from the pool to the specified address without any access control checks. This means that unauthorized parties can potentially receive the collateral from the pool by exploiting this lack of access control.

## Impact
The lack of access control when moving collateral from the pool to the specified address poses a security risk. Unauthorized parties can abuse this vulnerability to gain control over the collateral, potentially leading to loss or manipulation of assets within the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement Access Control: Introduce access control checks to verify the authorization of the caller and the specified collateral receiver address. This can be achieved using modifiers or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict the execution of the _transferFromPoolToAddress function.
