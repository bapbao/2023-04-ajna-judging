# XO- `revokeLPTransferors` function  prevent users from `transferring LP tokens`

## Summary
- The vulnerability can loop to delete elements from the `allowances_` mapping that it should not delete. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
  function revokeLPTransferors(
        mapping(address => bool) storage allowances_,
        address[] calldata transferors_
    ) external  {
        uint256 transferorsLength = transferors_.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < transferorsLength; ) {
            delete allowances_[transferors_[i]];

            unchecked { ++i; }
        }

        emit RevokeLPTransferors(
            msg.sender,
            transferors_
        );
    }
```
- this `delete allowances_[transferors_[i]];` make a problem that line will delete the the `transferors_[i]` element from the `allowances_` mapping, but it will not update the `i` index. so that the next time the loop is gone to iterates, it will try to delete the element at index 
`i + 1`, which may not exist.
## Impact
- the vulnerability can cause the loop to delete elements from the `allowances_` mapping that it should not delete.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- it's should update the `i` index after deleting the element from the `allowances_` mapping.
