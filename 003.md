# Unsafe flash loan usage in FlashloanablePool

## Summary

The `FlashloanablePool` contract exposes a `flashLoan` function that could be vulnerable to an attack due to insufficient checking of the returned funds. The contract checks if the balance after the flash loan is equal to the initial balance, but doesn't handle the scenario where the balance could be manipulated during the flash loan execution.

## Vulnerability Detail

While the contract checks that the token balance of the contract is equal to the initial balance after a flash loan, it does not account for potential manipulations of the token balance during the execution of the flash loan. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the balance of the contract during the flash loan execution, leading to an imbalance in the pool.

## Impact

An attacker could use this vulnerability to manipulate the balance of the pool, which could lead to financial loss for the pool's participants.

## Code Snippet

Here's the problematic part of the `flashLoan` function:

```solidity
tokenContract.safeTransferFrom(
    address(receiver_),
    address(this),
    amount_
);

if (tokenContract.balanceOf(address(this)) != initialBalance) revert FlashloanIncorrectBalance();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A more robust check should be implemented to ensure that the exact amount borrowed is returned. This could be done by storing the balance before the `safeTransferFrom` call and then comparing this with the balance after the call. If the balances do not match, the function should revert.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce the vulnerability, you can do the following:

1. Implement a malicious contract that inherits from `IERC3156FlashBorrower` and overrides the `onFlashLoan` function.
2. In the `onFlashLoan` function, manipulate the token balance of the `FlashloanablePool` contract.
3. Call the `flashLoan` function from the `FlashloanablePool` contract, passing the malicious contract as the receiver.
4. Observe that the pool's balance is not as expected after the flash loan, leading to an imbalance in the pool.
