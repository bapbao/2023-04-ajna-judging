# Users are unable to `unstake` and `emergencyUnstake`

## Summary
Users are unable to unstake NFTs and emergencyUnstake NFTs 

## Vulnerability Detail
when users try to unstake their NFT, the `unstake` and  `emergencyUnstake` function will fail due to a missing approval to transfer the NFT from the contract to the caller. If you check the Open Zeppekin implementation:

 you can see that when calling transferFrom, it is required an approval before hand to actually transfer the NFT.

## Impact
Users are unable to unstake their NFTs (stuck NFTs)

## Recommendation
