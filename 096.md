# Rounding issue in MAU calculation leads to interest rates not being raised for a certain range of utilization

## Summary
The ```updateInterestState``` function from ```PoolCommons``` attempts to check if interest rate needs to be raised/decreased based on a set of relationships(equations) between MAU and TU. One of these equations yields incorrect values.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```updateInterestState``` function from ```PoolCommons.sol``` is called via ```Pool.sol : _updateInterestState``` after every major interaction with the pool. This function checks if the interest rates need to be changed and calculates the new Interest Rate. The call flow is ```Pool.sol : _updateInterestState => PoolCommons.sol => updateInterestState => _calculateInterestRate```. 
Here is the function ```_calculateInterestRate``` from [PoolCommons.sol#L269](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L269)

```solidity
    function _calculateInterestRate(
        PoolState memory poolState_,
        uint256 debtEma_,
        uint256 depositEma_,
        uint256 debtColEma_,
        uint256 lupt0DebtEma_
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 newInterestRate_)  {
        // meaningful actual utilization
        int256 mau;
        // meaningful actual utilization * 1.02
        int256 mau102;

        if (poolState_.debt != 0) {
            // calculate meaningful actual utilization for interest rate update
            mau    = int256(_utilization(debtEma_, depositEma_));
            mau102 = mau * PERCENT_102 / 1e18;
        }

        // calculate target utilization
        int256 tu = (lupt0DebtEma_ != 0) ? 
            int256(Maths.wdiv(debtColEma_, lupt0DebtEma_)) : int(Maths.WAD);

        newInterestRate_ = poolState_.rate;

        // raise rates if 4*(tu-1.02*mau) < (tu+1.02*mau-1)^2-1
        if (4 * (tu - mau102) < (((tu + mau102 - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2) - 1e18) {
            newInterestRate_ = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, INCREASE_COEFFICIENT);
        // decrease rates if 4*(tu-mau) > 1-(tu+mau-1)^2
        } else if (4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) ** 2) / 1e18) {
            newInterestRate_ = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, DECREASE_COEFFICIENT);
        }

        // bound rates between 10 bps and 50000%
        newInterestRate_ = Maths.min(500 * 1e18, Maths.max(0.001 * 1e18, newInterestRate_));
    }
```
We can see that it decides whether to increase or decrease rates based on a set of equations, as was defined in the whitepaper. 

The interesting point here is the difference between these two equations, the ```mau102``` variable. According to my discussion with the developers, ```"the reason for the 1.02 factor is to compress the green part "raise rates" so that anytime the MAU exceeds ~98%, regardless of TU, rates will increase```. 

Also, when I asked them if this factor was important, they said ```''yes, the 1.02 is there intentionally, so that we raise rates for very high utilizations regardless of TU''```

However this intention is not fulfilled because the mau102 functionality is broken. The reason is how the mau102 variable is calculated, ```mau102 = mau * PERCENT_102 / 1e18```

When we evaluate this expression, it turns out that the mau102 = mau because of a rounding issue. See declaration of variable ```PERCENT_102``` at [PoolCommons.sol#L34](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L34).

So ```mau102 = mau * (1.02 * 1e18 )/1e18``` = mau
I tested this in remix. This is because since PERCENT_102 is a constant, at compile time all occurences of it are replaced by the result of the expression 1.02 * 1e18. So what is actually stored as this variable is the result of ```(1.02 * 1e18)```. Now since this stored value is a single number ```1020000000000000000``` instead of 1.02 * 1e18, the expression for mau102 becomes 

```mau102 = mau * 1020000000000000000/1e18```
Since this is division before multiplication, so the second term rounds down to 1 and thus mau102 = mau.

## Impact
Due to an inaccuracy in the representation of mau102, the purpose of this variable is completely defeated. The increase-rate equation check becomes ```if (4 * (tu - mau) < (((tu + mau - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2) - 1e18) { newInterestRate_ = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, INCREASE_COEFFICIENT);``` instead of the expected ```if (4 * (tu - mau102) < (((tu + mau102 - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2) - 1e18) { newInterestRate_ = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, INCREASE_COEFFICIENT);```. Now, the interest rate would not be raised for an additional 2 % range between mau and tu. 

This is a medium severity finding because at very high utilization rates, even 2 % difference makes sense, and that was the reason behind implementing it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change ```mau102 = mau * PERCENT_102 / 1e18``` to ```mau102 = (mau * PERCENT_102 )/ 1e18``` to prevent rounding and ensure proper calculation of mau102.
