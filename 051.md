# User will not be able to redeem his LPs as his position is deleted

## Summary

In PositionManager.sol, there is a delete keyword inside of for loop before transfer lpAmounts back to the user

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling redeemPositions(), the function first iterates over bucketIndexes and after that removes LP tracked by position manager at certain bucket index at the end of for loop using delete keyword:

TokenInfo and Position structs where lps accounting is implemented:

So when transferLP() is called with _indexes param, it turns out that user doesn't hold anything due to deletion of his entire position at given bucket index:

## Impact

High. Users will lose their positions because of deletion tokenInfo.positions[_index] mapping where accounting for lp tokens for a user is held.

## Code Snippet

Provided above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The mapping with user position should be cleared out after transferLP() and not before.
