# (DOS) fundingVote() function in GrantFund.sol will always revert.

## Summary
The if statement used to check that the funding stage is active in fundingVote() is faulty because it reverts in all conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Looking at the IF statement below, you'll notice that if the block.number in which `fundingVote()` is called  is < or = or > than _getFundingStageEndBlock(startBlock) the function will revert InvalidVote(), that means the if statement reverts in all conditions.

```solidity
uint256 screeningStageEndBlock = _getScreeningStageEndBlock(startBlock);

 if (block.number <= screeningStageEndBlock || block.number > _getFundingStageEndBlock(startBlock)) revert InvalidVote();
```

## Impact
users won't be able to use the `fundingVote()` function.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
rewrite the if statement to only revert if the fundingVote() function is called at the end of the voting period.
