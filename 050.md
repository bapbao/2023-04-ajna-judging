# increaseLPAllowance() mistakenly calls for the owner of the lpAmounts

## Summary

When calling redeemPositions(), there is increaseAllowance() function call where the contract gives the owner allowance to spend the LP amounts

## Vulnerability Detail

In PositionManager.sol, before calling transferLP() to transfer lpAmounts you need to first call increaseLPAllowance(). It should be done in memorializePositions() (another issue) for the address(this) but instead, it's implemented in redeemPositions() and owner is pointed as the spender. However, transferring LPs to the contract doesn't make the contract its owner, only the spender. And owner cannot become the spender as he's the initial owner. 

## Impact

High. Incorrect implementation of the allowance logic for the tokens and user cannot redeem his positions as he's already an owner and in increaseLPAllowance() function it's checked if  _lpAllowances[msg.sender][spender_]. Therefore his allowed amount will be 0 and he didn't allow himself any tokens

## Recommendation

It's recommended to use standard implementations for the tokens as the best practice to avoid such mistakes
