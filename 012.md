# Block time is not the same across different networks

## Summary

Different networks have different block times so while it might take 12 seconds to mine a block on Ethereum, it is substantially faster on other chains like polygon.

## Vulnerability Detail

The period lengths e.g. funding period length, screening period length does not match the intended period length.

## Impact

On networks with lower block times, the distribution will happen a lot faster. This may cause a lot of unintended side effects like the community not having enough time to vet and vote on proposals.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of hardcoding these values in the storage contract, allow the deployer to specify these constants in the constructor of the GrantFund contract similar to how the deployer is able to specify the deployed ajna token address.
