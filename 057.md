# Anyone  can mint the NFTs in the PositionManager.sol contract, Stake them and can earn ajna tokens

## Summary

In the PositionManager.sol contract, the mint() function does not have any access control. So anybody can mint any number of NFTs they want and stake them and can earn Rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

The mint function in the PositionManger.sol allows anyone to mint the LP NFTs.So even a person who is not the Lender can also mint the NFT, Stake, and earn rewards

## Impact

The protocol can loose Significant amount funds (Rewards) if anyone can mint and stake the LP NFTs other than Lenders

## Code Snippet

   function mint(
        address pool_,
        address recipient_,
        bytes32 poolSubsetHash_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 tokenId_) {
        // revert if the address is not a valid Ajna pool
        if (!_isAjnaPool(pool_, poolSubsetHash_)) revert NotAjnaPool();

        tokenId_ = _nextId++;

        // record which pool the tokenId was minted in
        positionTokens[tokenId_].pool = pool_;

        _mint(recipient_, tokenId_);

        emit Mint(recipient_, pool_, tokenId_);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Access control should be implemented on the mint function so that only Lenders can mint the LP NFTs
