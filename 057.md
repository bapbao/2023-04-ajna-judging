# XO-`repayDebt() ` function does not check ` limitIndex_ parameter ` for validity.

## Summary
- The `repayDebt()` function in the `IERC20PoolBorrowerActions` interface does not check the `limitIndex_parameter `  for validity. This means that an attacker could potentially set the `limitIndex_parameter `  to a very high value, which would allow them to pull more collateral than they are entitled to.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
     */
    function repayDebt(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_,
        uint256 collateralAmountToPull_,
        address recipient_,
        uint256 limitIndex_
    ) external;
}
```

- the `IERC20PoolBorrowerActions` interface has a vulnerability present in the `repayDebt()` function, so interface `IERC20PoolBorrowerActions.` It defines two functions: `drawDebt()` and `repayDebt().`

- The `drawDebt()` function allows borrowers to add collateral to the pool `and/or` borrow quote from the pool. The `repayDebt()` function allows borrowers to repay borrowed quote to the pool, `and/or` pull collateral form the pool. So the problem is in the `repayDebt()` function. The function takes a parameter called `limitIndex_.` This parameter is used to ensure that the `LUP` has not moved far from its state when the borrower pulls collateral, the `limitIndex_` parameter is not checked for validity. This means that an attacker could set the `limitIndex_` parameter to a very high value, which would allow them to pull more collateral than they are entitled to.
## Impact
- an attacker can exploit the vulnerability as : 
- Set the `limitIndex_parameter `  to a very high value.
- Call the `repayDebt()` function.
- The borrower will be able to pull more `collateral` than they are entitled to.
- The borrower can then sell the `collateral` for a profit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the ` repayDebt() ` function should check the.   ` limitIndex_ parameter ` for validity. The function should only allow the borrower to pull collateral if the ` limitIndex_ parameter `  is less than or equal to the current ` LUP. `
