# Potential Overflow in _bubbleUp and _bubbleDown functions in Loans.sol

## Summary

The `_bubbleUp` and `_bubbleDown` functions in the `Loans.sol` contract perform arithmetic operations without appropriate checks, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow, and subsequent incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_bubbleUp` and `_bubbleDown` functions in `Loans.sol` perform division on the `index_` parameter without validating it, potentially leading to a division by zero error. The `index_` variable is also used in multiplication, creating a potential overflow issue.

In the `_bubbleUp` function, `index_ / 2` is calculated without validating that `index_` is not zero, potentially leading to a division by zero error.

In the `_bubbleDown` function, `index_ * 2` is calculated without overflow checks, potentially leading to integer overflow if `index_` is sufficiently large.

## Impact

In the case of the `_bubbleUp` function, if `index_` were to be zero, the function could cause a division by zero error, causing a transaction to fail.

In the case of the `_bubbleDown` function, if `index_` is sufficiently large, the function could cause integer overflow, potentially resulting in an incorrect index being calculated, leading to unexpected behavior, such as manipulation of unexpected memory locations.

## Code Snippet

Here are the problematic lines from `Loans.sol`:

_bubbleUp:

```solidity
function _bubbleUp(LoansState storage loans_, Loan memory loan_, uint index_) private {
    uint256 count = loans_.loans.length;
    if (index_ == ROOT_INDEX || loan_.thresholdPrice <= loans_.loans[index_ / 2].thresholdPrice){
      _insert(loans_, loan_, index_, count);
    } else {
      _insert(loans_, loans_.loans[index_ / 2], index_, count);
      _bubbleUp(loans_, loan_, index_ / 2);
    }
}
```

_bubbleDown:

```solidity
function _bubbleDown(LoansState storage loans_, Loan memory loan_, uint index_) private {

    uint cIndex = index_ * 2;

    uint256 count = loans_.loans.length;
    if (count <= cIndex) {
        _insert(loans_, loan_, index_, count);
    } else {
        Loan memory largestChild = loans_.loans[cIndex];
        ...
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement checks for these scenarios:

1. For `_bubbleUp`, check if `index_` is not zero before performing division. In solidity, this can be done using `require(index_ != 0, "Index cannot be zero");`.

2. For `_bubbleDown`, use a safe multiplication function that checks for overflow before performing the multiplication. This could be a custom function or a library function such as `SafeMath.mul`.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce the vulnerability, you can perform the following steps:

1. Deploy the contract with a valid initial setup.
2. Call the function that eventually calls `_bubbleUp` or `_bubbleDown` with an `index_` of `0` (for `_bubbleUp`) or a sufficiently large `index_` (for `_bubbleDown`).
3. Observe the division by zero error in `_bubbleUp` or integer overflow in `_bubbleDown`.
