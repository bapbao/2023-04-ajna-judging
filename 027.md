# XO-`Unbounded Debt` Settlement Vulnerability in `Pool Settler` Actions Contract

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in is the `maxDepth_` parameter of the `settle()` function. This parameter is used to prevent unbounded iteration clearing large liquidations, if the `maxDepth_` parameter is set to a very high value, an attacker could exploit this bug to settle an unlimited amount of debt.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/**
     *  @notice Called by actors to settle an amount of debt in a completed liquidation.
     *  @param  borrowerAddress_ Address of the auctioned borrower.
     *  @param  maxDepth_        Measured from `HPB`, maximum number of buckets deep to settle debt.
     *  @dev    `maxDepth_` is used to prevent unbounded iteration clearing large liquidations.
     */
    function settle(
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 maxDepth_
    ) external;
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the  `settle()` function, the problem is the function allows actors to settle an amount of debt in a completed liquidation. The function takes two parameters: the address of the auctioned borrower and the maximum number of buckets deep to settle debt, `The` maxDepth_ parameter is used to prevent unbounded iteration clearing large liquidations.
so If the `maxDepth_` parameter is set to a very high value, an attacker can exploit this vlnerability to `settle` an unlimited amount of debt.
an  attacker would first need to obtain the address of the pool settler actions contract. They could then call the `settle()` function with a very high value for the `maxDepth_` parameter. This would cause the contract to iterate through an unlimited number of buckets, clearing an unlimited amount of debt and this exploitation going to lead to drain the pool of funds, or to cause other financial losses.
## Impact
- for exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would follow these steps:
    - Obtain the address of the Pool Settler Actions contract.
    - Call the `settle()` function with a very high value for the `maxDepth_` parameter.
    - This can be done using a script or interacting with the contract directly.
    - The attacker's transaction would be done .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `maxDepth_` parameter should be limited to a reasonable value. The exact value of the limit would depend on the specific application of the pool settler actions contract.
