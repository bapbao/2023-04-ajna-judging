# `redeemPositions` will always revert due to access control issues, and prevent token owners from getting their LPs back

## Summary
`redeemPositions` method in the `PositionManager.sol` contract makes an additional call to the pool contract to transfer LPs, but it will revert due to access control issues, and prevent token owners from getting their LPs back.

## Vulnerability Detail
`PositionManager.sol` contract has two counter functions where one of them transfers ownership of the LPs from the owner to the `PositionManager.sol` contract, and the other one transfers LPs from `PositionManager.sol` contract to the owner. These functions are: `memorializePositions` and `redeemPositions`.

Both these methods perform some checks, and at the end, they make an external call to the `Pool` contract, and call the same `transferLP` function.

```solidity
// File: PositionManager.sol
// Method: memorializePositions()

251.   // update pool LP accounting and transfer ownership of LP to PositionManager contract
252.   pool.transferLP(owner, address(this), indexes_);

// Method: redeemPositions()
453.   // update pool lps accounting and transfer ownership of lps from PositionManager contract
454.   pool.transferLP(address(this), owner, indexes_);
```

The `transferLP` method in the `Pool.sol` contract will take these arguments and perform the `transferLP` method in the `LPActions.sol` library using additional storage variables. You can see it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L510-L523) and below:

```solidity
// File: Pool.sol
    function transferLP(
        address owner_,
        address newOwner_,
        uint256[] calldata indexes_
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        LPActions.transferLP(
            buckets,
            _lpAllowances,
            approvedTransferors,
            owner_,
            newOwner_,
            indexes_
        );
    }
```

When it happens, the first thing that the `transferLP` function in the `LPActions.sol` library does [is to check if the `msg.sender` is the new owner.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LPActions.sol#L218) Transaction will revert if the `msg.sender` is not the new owner.

```solidity
// File: LPActions.sol
218.    if (newOwnerAddress_ != msg.sender && !approvedTransferors_[newOwnerAddress_][msg.sender]) revert TransferorNotApproved();
```

As I mentioned above, both of these methods are called from the `PositionManager.sol` contract and the `msg.sender` is this contract's address. While `newOwnerAddress_` is the contract's address in the `memorializePositions`, it is the token owner's address in the `redeemPositions`.

It is impossible for these two functions to work as intended with the same `msg.sender`. Because these methods are called from the `PositionsManager.sol` contract, `memorializePositions` will not revert but `redeemPositions` will always revert due to the token's owner is not the `msg.sender`.

## Impact
Users can not redeem their positions with the `PositionManager.sol` contract and this might cause a significant loss of funds.

One can argue that the users can call the function in the `Pool.sol` directly to get their LPs but this requires `PositionManager` to increase the allowance of the user. The `pool.increaseLPAllowance` method is called right before the `pool.transferLP` in the `PositionManager.sol` contract but this will also revert, and there is no other method that PositionManager can increase the allowance of the actual token owner. Besides that, all of the state changes about the positions will be reverted too.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`transferLP` method in the `LPActions.sol` library might check if the `msg.sender` is not only the new owner but also the previous owner too. This will prevent the current issue to happen but letting both previous and new owner to perform the transaction might require additional checks about access control.
