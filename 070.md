# Overriding AJNA token address in GrantFund.sol constructor

## Summary
GrantFund.sol deployer will have to override the hardcoded AJNA address in Storage.sol.

## Vulnerability Detail
GrantFund constructor updates ajnaTokenAddress in the Storage contract which is deployed earlier than GrantFund. 

## Impact
Assigning value to ajnaTokenAddress in Storage has no sense as it is being overridden in the GrantFund constructor.
Deployer HAS to provide a token address to the constructor again. 
If passed wrong token address at deployment, the contract will not work.

## Code Snippet
[Storage.sol#L55
](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/Storage.sol#L55)
```solidity    
address public ajnaTokenAddress =
        0x9a96ec9B57Fb64FbC60B423d1f4da7691Bd35079;
```

[GrantFund.sol#L46](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/GrantFund.sol#L46)
```solidity
    constructor(address ajnaToken_) {
        ajnaTokenAddress = ajnaToken_;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pick one:
a) Remove hardcoding ajnaTokenAddress in Storage.sol
b) Remove the constructor from GrantFund.sol
