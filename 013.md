# XO-`deployPool` function does not check `interestRate_` parameter for validity

## Summary
-  The `deployPool` function in the `ERC20PoolFactory` contract does not check if the `interestRate_` parameter is valid. This means that an attacker could pass in a negative or zero interest rate, which would allow them to create a pool with no interest.
## Vulnerability Detail
- The vulnerability in the `ERC20PoolFactory` contract is present in the `deployPool` function here is is the line :
```solidity
function deployPool(
        address collateral_, address quote_, uint256 interestRate_
    ) external canDeploy(collateral_, quote_, interestRate_) returns (address pool_) {
        address existingPool = deployedPools[ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH][collateral_][quote_];
        if (existingPool != address(0)) revert IPoolFactory.PoolAlreadyExists(existingPool);

        uint256 quoteTokenScale = _getTokenScale(quote_);
        uint256 collateralScale = _getTokenScale(collateral_);

        bytes memory data = abi.encodePacked(
            PoolType.ERC20,
            ajna,
            collateral_,
            quote_,
            quoteTokenScale,
            collateralScale
        );

        ERC20Pool pool = ERC20Pool(address(implementation).clone(data));

        pool_ = address(pool);

        // Track the newly deployed pool
        deployedPools[ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH][collateral_][quote_] = pool_;
        deployedPoolsList.push(pool_);

        emit PoolCreated(pool_);

        pool.initialize(interestRate_);
    }
}
```
- so the problem is  the `deployPool` function. this function  is responsible for creating new `ERC20Pool` contracts. The `interestRate_` parameter is used to specify the interest rate for the new pool.
-  so the vulnerability is caused by the fact that the `interestRate_` parameter is not checked for validity. This means that an attacker can pass in any value for the `interestRate_` parameter, including a negative or zero value. This would allow the attacker to create a pool with no interest.
## Impact
- an attacker can exploit this vulnerability and leading to gain financial benefits. An attacker could create a pool with no interest, and then use that pool to attract users who are looking for a high-interest rate. Once the users have deposited their funds into the pool, the attacker could then withdraw the funds without paying any interest. This would be a significant loss for the users, and it would damage the reputation of the `ERC20PoolFactory` contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding a check to the `deployPool` function to ensure that the `interestRate_` parameter is positive.
