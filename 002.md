# Insufficient Signature Verification in `permit` Function

## Summary

The permit function of the `PermitERC721.sol` contract has insufficient checks when verifying the provided signature, which could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to other user's tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `permit` function is used to approve a spender to manage the user's token without requiring the user's private key. The function takes the spender's address, tokenId, deadline and a signature as inputs. The function verifies the signature using ECDSA and then approves the spender for accessing the token. However, the signature verification is flawed.

The `_checkSignature` function checks if the recovered address from the signature matches the spender, and whether the signature is valid. However, it also checks if the recovered address is either the owner of the token or an approved address, which means that if the recovered address is either the owner of the token or an approved address, it will return true regardless of whether the signature is valid or not.

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to other user's tokens. If the attacker can get a valid signature from the owner of a token or an approved address, they could use it to approve themselves as a spender for the token, potentially leading to loss of tokens for the user.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _checkSignature(
    bytes32 digest_,
    bytes memory signature_,
    address recoveredAddress_,
    uint256 tokenId_
) internal view returns (bool isValidPermit_) {

    bool isOwnerOrApproved =
        (recoveredAddress_ != address(0) && _isApprovedOrOwner(recoveredAddress_, tokenId_));

    bool isValidSignature =
        SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(
            ownerOf(tokenId_),
            digest_,
            signature_
        );

    isValidPermit_ = (isOwnerOrApproved || isValidSignature);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `isValidPermit_` should only return true if the signature is valid and the recovered address matches the spender. Remove the `isOwnerOrApproved` check from the `_checkSignature` function to ensure that the signature is always verified correctly.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the `PermitERC721` contract.
2. Mint a new token for user A.
3. User A approves user B for their token.
4. User B recovers the signature from a message signed by user A.
5. User B calls the `permit` function with the recovered signature and their own address as the spender.
6. Even if the signature is invalid, the `_checkSignature` function will return true because user B is an approved address.
7. User B is now approved to manage user A's token.
