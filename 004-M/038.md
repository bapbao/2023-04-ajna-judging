# Malicious user can steal delegate rewards in grant voting

## Summary
Malicious user can steal delegate rewards in grant voting

## Vulnerability Detail
https://faqs.ajna.finance/faqs/grants#what-is-the-ajna-grants-program
> The grant program for the Ajna Protocol provides funding for growth and development opportunities proposed by independent contractors and teams. Funding may be provided for an array of software development and growth related proposals. Applications are reviewed and voted on by AJNA tokenholders and professional delegates. Funds are granted programmatically based on the results of on-chain votes.

Grants are intended to be voted on and given to developers and or teams who want funding. This mechanism can be gamed by a malicious user let me explain how.

let us assume no one has voted and the sum of the vote is very low, a user can vote for a proposal that he created by himself and steal delegate reward (1 / 10 of the AJNA token fund available)

although there are checks in the code to deter this, those checks can be bypassed.

```solidity
 function claimDelegateReward(
        uint24 distributionId_
    ) external override returns (uint256 rewardClaimed_) {
        VoterInfo storage voter = _voterInfo[distributionId_][msg.sender];

        // Revert if delegatee didn't vote in screening stage
        
        // @audit
        // user can just create a random vote and vote for them to claim the delegation reward
        if (voter.screeningVotesCast == 0) revert DelegateRewardInvalid();

        DistributionPeriod storage currentDistribution = _distributions[distributionId_];

        // Check if the distribution period is still active
        if (block.number <= currentDistribution.endBlock) revert DistributionPeriodStillActive();

        // check rewards haven't already been claimed
        if (voter.hasClaimedReward) revert RewardAlreadyClaimed();

        // calculate rewards earned for voting
        rewardClaimed_ = _getDelegateReward(currentDistribution, voter);

        voter.hasClaimedReward = true;
        

        emit DelegateRewardClaimed(
            msg.sender,
            distributionId_,
            rewardClaimed_
        );

        // transfer rewards to delegatee
        if (rewardClaimed_ != 0) IERC20(ajnaTokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewardClaimed_);
    }
```
above is the function which allows a user to claim their delegate rewards. In this function there is a check...
```solidity
if (voter.screeningVotesCast == 0) revert DelegateRewardInvalid();
```
this if statement is in place to prevent someone who has not cast a vote, to not be able to claim the rewards.

but this is not really effective, a malicious user can just contribute 1 wei token of screen vote to bypass this check
and claim the delegate reward.

## Impact
A malicious user can steal delegate rewards in grant voting

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 instead of checking voter.screeningVotesCast == 0, set a min vote threshold for user's screen vote cast minimum and the funding vote minimum.
example:
```solidity
if (voter.screeningVotesCast < screeningVotesCast_min_threshold) revert DelegateRewardInvalid();
```
