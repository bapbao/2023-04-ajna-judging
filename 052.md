# GrantFund storage variables will not work in chains which block time is not 12 seconds

## Summary
GrantFund storage variables will not work in chains which block time is not 12 seconds

## Vulnerability Detail
The following variables from the storage contract that is inherited by the  `GrantFund `:

```@solidity
   uint256 internal constant CHALLENGE_PERIOD_LENGTH = 50_400;

    /**
     * @notice Length of the distribution period in blocks.
     * @dev    Roughly equivalent to the number of blocks in 90 days.
     */
    uint48 internal constant DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH = 648_000;

    /**
     * @notice Length of the funding stage of the distribution period in blocks.
     * @dev    Roughly equivalent to the number of blocks in 10 days.
     */
    uint256 internal constant FUNDING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 72_000;

    /**
     * @notice Length of the screening stage of the distribution period in blocks.
     * @dev    Roughly equivalent to the number of blocks in 73 days.
     */
    uint256 internal constant SCREENING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 525_600;
```

are using the block time of eth, which after the merge is 12seconds per block. As the docs say, ajna pretends to deploy to other blockchains as arbitrum too, where the block time in roughly 15  seconds and others like Fantom, 0.8 seconds.

All the calculations, requirements, assertions or functions interacting with this variables in any of the following blockchains: `Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche` where the block time is not 12 seconds, will be completely wrong, breaking any core functionality that integrates with those variables.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using variables with number of blocks, as the protocol is multichain, use number of seconds.

Example: 
```@solidity
Before:   uint256 internal constant FUNDING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 72_000; //blocks of 12 seconds in 10 days
After:      uint256 internal constant FUNDING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 864000; //seconds in 10 days
```
