# `kickReserveAuction()` uses outdated pool data

## Summary
The function doesn't accrue the pool's interest before initiating the auction.

## Vulnerability Detail
```sol
    function kickReserveAuction() external override nonReentrant {
        // start a new claimable reserve auction, passing in relevant parameters such as the current pool size, debt, balance, and inflator value
        uint256 kickerAward = KickerActions.kickReserveAuction(
            auctions,
            reserveAuction,
            KickReserveAuctionParams({
                poolSize:    Deposits.treeSum(deposits),
                t0PoolDebt:  poolBalances.t0Debt,
                poolBalance: _getNormalizedPoolQuoteTokenBalance(),
                inflator:    inflatorState.inflator
            })
        );

        // transfer kicker award to msg.sender
        _transferQuoteToken(msg.sender, kickerAward);
    }
```

It passes the pool's `inflator`. But, that value can be outdated. You have to first accrue the pool's interest by calling `_accruePoolInterest()`:

```sol
   function _accruePoolInterest() internal returns (PoolState memory poolState_) {
        poolState_.t0Debt          = poolBalances.t0Debt;
        poolState_.t0DebtInAuction = poolBalances.t0DebtInAuction;
        poolState_.collateral      = poolBalances.pledgedCollateral;
        poolState_.inflator        = inflatorState.inflator;
        poolState_.rate            = interestState.interestRate;
        poolState_.poolType        = _getArgUint8(POOL_TYPE);
        poolState_.quoteTokenScale = _getArgUint256(QUOTE_SCALE);

	    // check if t0Debt is not equal to 0, indicating that there is debt to be tracked for the pool
        if (poolState_.t0Debt != 0) {
            // Calculate prior pool debt
            poolState_.debt = Maths.wmul(poolState_.t0Debt, poolState_.inflator);

	        // calculate elapsed time since inflator was last updated
            uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - inflatorState.inflatorUpdate;

	        // set isNewInterestAccrued field to true if elapsed time is not 0, indicating that new interest may have accrued
            poolState_.isNewInterestAccrued = elapsed != 0;

            // if new interest may have accrued, call accrueInterest function and update inflator and debt fields of poolState_ struct
            if (poolState_.isNewInterestAccrued) {
                (uint256 newInflator, uint256 newInterest) = PoolCommons.accrueInterest(
                    emaState,
                    deposits,
                    poolState_,
                    Loans.getMax(loans).thresholdPrice,
                    elapsed
                );
                poolState_.inflator = newInflator;
                // After debt owed to lenders has accrued, calculate current debt owed by borrowers
                poolState_.debt = Maths.wmul(poolState_.t0Debt, poolState_.inflator);

                // update total interest earned accumulator with the newly accrued interest
                reserveAuction.totalInterestEarned += newInterest;
            }
        }
    }
```

The value is used to determine the pool's claimable reserves. It will be lower because the existing interest wasn't accrued:
```sol
    function kickReserveAuction(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        ReserveAuctionState storage reserveAuction_,
        KickReserveAuctionParams calldata params_
    ) external returns (uint256 kickerAward_) {
        // retrieve timestamp of latest burn event and last burn timestamp
        uint256 latestBurnEpoch   = reserveAuction_.latestBurnEventEpoch;
        uint256 lastBurnTimestamp = reserveAuction_.burnEvents[latestBurnEpoch].timestamp;

        // check that at least two weeks have passed since the last reserve auction completed, and that the auction was not kicked within the past 72 hours
        if (block.timestamp < lastBurnTimestamp + 2 weeks || block.timestamp - reserveAuction_.kicked <= 72 hours) {
            revert ReserveAuctionTooSoon();
        }

        uint256 curUnclaimedAuctionReserve = reserveAuction_.unclaimed;

        uint256 claimable = _claimableReserves(
            Maths.wmul(params_.t0PoolDebt, params_.inflator),
            params_.poolSize,
            auctions_.totalBondEscrowed,
            curUnclaimedAuctionReserve,
            params_.poolBalance
        );

        // ...
    }
```
