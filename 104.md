# Mathematical Discrepancies in equations used for calculating Interest Rates

## Summary
The two equations representing MAU - TU relationships that are used to check whether the Interest Rate should be decreased or Increased based on current state, are not homogenous. The implementation of these yields different values in calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The two equations seen at ```PoolCommons.sol:L294``` and ```L297``` are checks that allow increasing or decreasing interest rates based on the current values of ```Meaningful Actual Utilization MAU``` and ```Target Utilization TU```. The two equations are comparing same quantities mau and tu and should have same similar scaling/downscaling. Here is the code :

```solidity
        if (4 * (tu - mau102) < (((tu + mau102 - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2) - 1e18) {
            newInterestRate_ = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, INCREASE_COEFFICIENT);
        // decrease rates if 4*(tu-mau) > 1-(tu+mau-1)^2
        } else if (4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) ** 2) / 1e18) {
            newInterestRate_ = Maths.wmul(poolState_.rate, DECREASE_COEFFICIENT);
        }

        // bound rates between 10 bps and 50000%
        newInterestRate_ = Maths.min(500 * 1e18, Maths.max(0.001 * 1e18, newInterestRate_));
    }
```

We notice a difference in how they use downscaling by 1e9 or 1e18 to attain WAD(1e18) precision on both sides of the inequality.
 
We are interested in the term ```(tu + mau102 - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2)```. For the increase rate check, ```(tu + mau102 - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2)``` is used, but notice that for the decrease rate check, ```((tu + mau - 1e18) ** 2) / 1e18)``` is used instead. This discrepancy will lead to a different set of results for this expression in some cases. 

When I asked the developers, why this discrepancy exists, they said ```"so the thing is that during the invariant testing, with some huge values, the first one overflowed, let me find the commit so we decided to make it allow higher values, by dividing by 1e9 and then pow 2, instead having the 1e18 at pow 2 and then / 1e18. But the else branch wasn't changed, as we hit no failure there."```

They changed the first equation to deal with an overflow issue, but they did not consider changing the second one because it did not overflow. But they expected it to be mathematically the same. One of the developers said, ```"mathematically they should be the same IMO... not sure why differences, granted the else clause would be better written same way e.g. (4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2)"```

The effect of this discrepancy is that for some sets of values both these terms aren't equivalent. I plotted these two expressions here : https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cjaiyhtmob
So the mathematical equation yields different values than was expected and what the equation should represent.

## Impact
The mathematical equation used was not the one that was intended. There is a clear discrepancy in the results of these equations and thus this is a medium severity issue because the protocol will not work as expected in some cases. 

One of the developers agreed, ```"mathematically they should be the same IMO... not sure why differences, granted the else clause would be better written same way e.g. (4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2)"```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change Line 297 from  ```4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) ** 2) / 1e18)``` to ```4 * (tu - mau) > 1e18 - ((tu + mau - 1e18) / 1e9) ** 2)```
