# `Math.wdiv` may misbehave and revert on edge cases, even if the result is within the bound

## Summary
`Math.wdiv` may misbehave and revert on edge cases, even if the result is within the bound

## Vulnerability Detail
The edge case would be for example, when `x = 2^256 - 1` and `y = 2^128+1` , so `(x * WAD + y / 2)  / y` will lead to `uint256` overflow on the first multiplication. However, the actual result should be equal to `2^128 - 1` (which is a valid value).

## Impact
The implementation of `wdiv` in the library currently doesn't cover all edge cases, which is an unexpected behavior for the base library.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Update the implementation so that it can do full multiplication first and cover all edge cases. For example, use the following implementation mulDiv:

*(and add 1 if the remainder of `x mod y` is >= `(y+1) / 2` to get the same rounding behavior).
