# Delegate Reward can be claimed when distribution period is still active(i.e during the 90 days period) on some L2 chains

## Summary
The problem lies in the hardcoded `DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH` which means different time/date on some L2 chains like Optimism, Bsc, Avalanche e.t.c.

## Vulnerability Detail
This check is used in the `claimDelegateReward()` function to ensure the function can't be called when the distribution period is still active 

```solidity
 if (block.number <= currentDistribution.endBlock) revert DistributionPeriodStillActive();
```
but this check won't be effective since the distribution period is hardcoded to be roughly equivalent to the number of blocks in 90 days and block time in some L2's  is different from mainnet's blocktime for some L2 chains. like optimism and Bsc e.t.c
```solidity
  uint48 internal constant DISTRIBUTION_PERIOD_LENGTH = 648_000; //@audit-info only feasible on mainnet
```

so the `claimDelegateReward()` function will be callable by voters within the 90 days of distribution period.

## Impact
Delegate Reward can be claimed when distribution period is still active

## Recommendation
avoid using hardcoded block number. For some chains, block.number is NOT a reliable source of timing information.
