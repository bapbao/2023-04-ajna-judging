# XO-`deployPool()` function in the `IERC721PoolFactory` allows attacker to create pool with no collateral

## Summary
- The `deployPool()` function in the `IERC721PoolFactory` contract does not check if the `tokenIds_` array is empty. This means that an attacker could deploy a pool with an empty array of token IDs. This would allow the attacker to create a pool with no collateral,
## Vulnerability Detail
- There is a vulnerability in the `IERC721PoolFactory` contract, specially in the `deployPool()` function,
```solidity
     */
    function deployPool(
        address collateral_,
        address quote_,
        uint256[] memory tokenIds_,
        uint256 interestRate_
    ) external returns (address pool_);

    /**
```
- so we have the `deployPool()` function is responsible for creating a new `IERC721Pool` contract. The function takes an array of token IDs as input, the token IDs represent the tokens that will be used as collateral for the pool. an the the problem that the contract does not check if the `tokenIds_` array is empty, this means that an attacker could deploy a pool with an empty array of token IDs. This would allow the attacker to create a pool with no collateral,
## Impact
- An attacker can deploy a pool with an empty array of token `IDs.` This would allow the attacker to create a `pool` with no `collateral.`
- An example of how can an attacker exploit this vulnerability:
    - an attacker creates a new IERC721PoolFactory contract.
    - an attacker deploys a pool with an empty array of token IDs.
    - an attacker borrows a large amount of money from the pool.
    - an attacker returns the money and closes the pool.
    - the pool has no collateral, so the attacker has effectively stolen the money.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- updating the `deployPool()` function to check if the `tokenIds_` array is empty. If the `array` is empty, the function should throw an error.
