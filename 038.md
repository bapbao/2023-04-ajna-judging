# Adopting the EIP-4494 Standard, Currently in its Draft Stage, May Lead to Potential Compatibility Challenges

## Summary

The PositionManager.sol contract in the Ajna protocol has employed the EIP-4494 standard for its permit implementation. Notably, this EIP is still in its Draft stage, which means it is prone to normative (breaking) changes. Such uncertainty could result in compatibility issues with the PositionManager contract, should the final approved EIP differ significantly from the current state.

Note that the tooltip that appears when hovering over the bolded **DRAFT!** label on the [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4494) page issues a caution:

```js
This EIP is not yet recommended for general use or implementation, as it is subject to normative (breaking) changes.
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The PositionManager.sol contract follows the EIP-4494 standard, currently in its Draft stage. As such, it presents certain risks associated with the instability of the EIP, which might undergo significant changes before reaching its final state, or might never gain approval at all. Consequently, this could lead to several complications such as:

- The contract might not align with the final approved version of the standard.
- The contract may be rendered incompatible with the standard chosen to implement the permit functionality for ERC721 tokens if EIP-4494 becomes obsolete.
- As tools are expected to support the final approved standard, future tool compatibility might be jeopardized.
- The contract may face issues similar to those caused by incorrect standard implementation.

## Impact

Adherence to a draft standard can lead to several issues, including non-compliance with the final standard, lack of support from future tools, and potential obsolescence if an alternate standard is chosen to implement the permit functionality for ERC721 tokens.

## Code Snippet

The code snippets provided below highlight the EIP-4494 standard's implementation:

- In the [PositionManager.sol file](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L40):

```solidity
contract PositionManager is ERC721, PermitERC721, IPositionManager, Multicall, ReentrancyGuard {
```

- In the [PermitERC721.sol file](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/base/PermitERC721.sol#L45-L50):

```solidity
/**
 *  @notice Functionality to enable `EIP-4494` permit calls as part of interactions with Position `NFT`s
 *  @dev    EIP-4494: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4494
 *  @dev    References this implementation: https://github.com/dievardump/erc721-with-permits/blob/main/contracts/ERC721WithPermit.sol

abstract contract PermitERC721 is ERC721, IPermit {

## Tool used

The evaluation of this issue was performed through a Manual Audit.

## Recommendation

In light of the potential issues stemming from the draft status of EIP-4494, we recommend the following actions:

- Remove all references to EIP-4494 within the contract.
- Clearly indicate that this contract is an implementation of the ERC721-Permit from Uniswap V3.
