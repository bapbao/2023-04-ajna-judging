# position is kicked in a outdated / stale neutral price, result in unfair liquidation

## Summary

position is kicked in a outdated / stale neutral price

## Vulnerability Detail

this code has a newly added function

```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc IPoolBorrowerActions
    function stampLoan() external override nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        uint256 newLup = BorrowerActions.stampLoan(
            auctions,
            deposits,
            loans,
            poolState
        );

        _updateInterestState(poolState, newLup);
    }
```

the comment of this function is:

```solidity
/**
 *  @notice Called by fully colalteralized borrowers to restamp the `Neutral Price` of the loan (only if loan is fully collateralized and not in auction).
 *          The reason for stamping the neutral price on the loan is to provide some certainty to the borrower as to at what price they can expect to be liquidated.
 *          This action can restamp only the loan of `msg.sender`.
 */
function stampLoan() external;
```

the neutral price is recorded when the auction is kicked, see 

```solidity 
// calculate auction params
        // neutral price is capped at 50 * max pool price
        vars.neutralPrice = Maths.min(
            Maths.wmul(borrower.t0Np, poolState_.inflator),
            MAX_NEUTRAL_PRICE
        );
``` 

here https://github.com/ajna-finance/ajna-core/blob/main/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L398 and used to determine auction price when auction is taken, see ```vars.auctionPrice = _auctionPrice(liquidation_.kickMomp, neutralPrice, kickTime);``` here https://github.com/ajna-finance/ajna-core/blob/main/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L715  

According to whitepaper 

> For each take above the neutral price (see 7.4 Liquidation Auctions), the kicker will lose some of
their bond. For each take called below an auction’s NP, the kicker will gain a reward on their
bond. The NP can be thought of as the borrower’s liquidation price, as it will be uneconomical
to liquidate a borrower if the liquidation auction does not clear below this price.

and the neutral price basically determines the fairness of liquidation

before kick user's position, the neutral price is never updated (the stamp loan is never called) before the _kick operation

this result in unfair liquidation and kick penalty being charged and determined by outdated neutral price

the recommendation before kick the auction, update the neutral price (whether or not by calling stamp loan)

## Impact

position is kicked in a outdated / stale neutral price, result in unfair liquidation

update neutral price before the kick of the auction in prepartion for liquidation
