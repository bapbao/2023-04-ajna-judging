# transferLP() call without calling increaseLPAllowance() in PositionManager.sol

## Summary

There is no increaseLPAllowance() call before transferLP pool call in memorializePositions()

## Vulnerability Detail

In PositionManager.sol, in memorializePositions() function, we call transferLP() without calling increaseLPAllowance() that is necessary for transferLP pool call (it's also said in the comments below in redeemPositions() function). This makes users not be able to memorialize their positions

## Impact

High as users will not be able to use PositionManager.sol and therefore RewardsManager.sol

## Recommendation
