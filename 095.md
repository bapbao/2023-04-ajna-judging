# Threshold Price can be incorrectly calculated as zero while calculating the liquidation bond size

## Summary
Due to a rounding issue in calculating threshold price in the ```bondParams``` function of ```PoolHelper.sol```, the Bond Factor will be significantly overestimated for many loan positions while kicking and will lead to incorrectly high bond penalties in many cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
Kicking of a loan involves calculating the bond factor and bond size. The call flow is ```Pool.sol : kick => KickerActions.sol : kick => _kick```. Now in the ```_kick``` function, at  [KickerActions.sol#L415](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L415) there is a call to _bondParams function to calculate bond factor and bond Size. Here we can see the ```_bondParams``` function of [PoolHelper.sol#L416](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/helpers/PoolHelper.sol#L416)

```solidity
    function _bondParams(
        uint256 borrowerDebt_,
        uint256 collateral_,
        uint256 momp_
    ) pure returns (uint256 bondFactor_, uint256 bondSize_) {
        uint256 thresholdPrice = borrowerDebt_  * Maths.WAD / collateral_;

        // bondFactor = min(30%, max(1%, (MOMP - thresholdPrice) / MOMP))
        if (thresholdPrice >= momp_) {
            bondFactor_ = 0.01 * 1e18;
        } else {
            bondFactor_ = Maths.min(
                0.3 * 1e18,
                Maths.max(
                    0.01 * 1e18,
                    1e18 - Maths.wdiv(thresholdPrice, momp_)
                )
            );
        }

        bondSize_ = Maths.wmul(bondFactor_,  borrowerDebt_);
    }
```

The issue is that ```thresholdPrice``` can go to zero due to a rounding error in most of the situations. 
1) The ```collateral_``` parameter here is the borrower's full collateral. Assume that there is more than 1 unit of collateral. Since collateral is represented in terms of 1e18, so we have lets say 2e18 collateral.
2) In the line ```uint256 thresholdPrice = borrowerDebt_  * Maths.WAD / collateral_;```, there is division before multiplication. So, the (Maths.WAD / collateral_) will round down to zero because Maths.WAD = 1e18 and collateral can be anything like 2e18.
3) So, ```thresholdPrice = borrowerDebt_ * 0``` = 0

Now in the next lines this ```thresholdPrice``` is used to evaluate the ```bondFactor_```. ```bondFactor_ = Maths.min( 0.3 * 1e18, Maths.max ( 0.01 * 1e18, 1e18 - Maths.wdiv(thresholdPrice, momp_))```. This expression will evaluate to bondFactor = 0.3 * 1e18 when ```thresholdPrice = 0```. Thus, due to a rounding error many kick calls will incorrectly lead to a bondFactor of 30 %. 

This ```bondFactor_``` is then recorded into the auction information and used to calculate the bond Size as well. Then when a user calls take, the flow is ```ERC20Pool.sol : take => TakerActions.sol : take => _take =>_prepareTake```. Inside the ```_prepareTake``` function, there is a call to function ```_bpf``` at [TakerActions.sol#L716](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L716) to calculate the Bond Payment Factor for the auction take. Here is the ```_bpf``` function from [PoolHelper.sol#L379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/helpers/PoolHelper.sol#L379)

```solidity
    function _bpf(
        uint256 debt_,
        uint256 collateral_,
        uint256 neutralPrice_,
        uint256 bondFactor_,
        uint256 auctionPrice_
    ) pure returns (int256) {
        int256 thresholdPrice = int256(Maths.wdiv(debt_, collateral_));

        int256 sign;
        if (thresholdPrice < int256(neutralPrice_)) {
            // BPF = BondFactor * min(1, max(-1, (neutralPrice - price) / (neutralPrice - thresholdPrice)))
            sign = Maths.minInt(
                1e18,
                Maths.maxInt(
                    -1 * 1e18,
                    PRBMathSD59x18.div(
                        int256(neutralPrice_) - int256(auctionPrice_),
                        int256(neutralPrice_) - thresholdPrice
                    )
                )
            );
        } else {
            int256 val = int256(neutralPrice_) - int256(auctionPrice_);
            if (val < 0 )      sign = -1e18;
            else if (val != 0) sign = 1e18;
        }

        return PRBMathSD59x18.mul(int256(bondFactor_), sign);
    }
```

We can see that at the last line the ```bondFactor_``` is used to calculate the Bond Payment Factor BPF. This BPF is then used to calculate the ```bondChange``` at [TakerActions.sol#L783](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L783) ie. the penalty/reward on the liq bond posted by the kicker as a result of this take. What this means is that ```thresholdPrice``` can be calculated incorrectly as zero due to rounding, thus leading to a much higher Bond Factor, which leads to a much higher Bond Payment Factor and the bpf then leads to a much higher bond penalty than it should have been.

## Impact
The impact is multi-fold.
1) Kickers will be discouraged to post such unnecessarily large liquidation bonds(because ```bondSize``` is also calculated using Bond Factor) for any borrower who has more than 1e18 collateral, which will be a very common occurence.
2) Even if the kicker posts such large bond, they will lose very significant amount of funds when liquidating large amounts of debt because of larger bond penalties.
Since there is a possibility of the kicker forfeiting all of his bond in certain cases, this is a High severity finding because of the consequences of very high Bond Payment Factor.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change ```uint256 thresholdPrice = borrowerDebt_  * Maths.WAD / collateral_;``` to ``` uint256 thresholdPrice = (borrowerDebt_  * Maths.WAD)  / collateral_;```. This will ensure proper thresholdPrice calculation.
