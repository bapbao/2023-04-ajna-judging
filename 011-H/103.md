# The `poolstate.debt` calculation inside the Pool contract can potentially be in favor of the user

## Summary

The `Pool.kick` function has potential rounding issues concerning the `poolstate.debt`, and rounding can be exploited in favor of the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Pool.kick` function can potentially set the `poolState.debt` to a value that is either rounded up or rounded down, due to the usage of the `Maths.wmul` function. `Maths.wmul` is returning a rounded up or rounded down result, rounded to the nearest `WAD = 10**18`; thus sometimes rounding in favor of the protocol and sometimes against the protocol.

A user can manipulate the rounding that happens in the `Maths.wmul` function by calling the `Pool.kick` function, in the following way:

Inside the `kick` function, the function `_accruePoolInterest` is called:

There `block.timestamp` is used to determine the inflator of the pool via the `elapsed` variable:

A malicious actor who can choose when to include the transaction to the block can determine the `block.timestamp`, thus they are able to influence the inflator of the pool. Thus it can be exploited against the protocol.

The inflator of the pool is then used by the user for the `Maths.wmul` function which can be exploited to round in favor of the user.

Here is some additional information about the user being able to predict the `block.timestamp`:

> Each slot has an expected timestamp, and a block without that exact timestamp is not valid. The block after the beacon chain genesis is expected to have a timestamp exactly 12 seconds after the genesis block. The block after it 12 seconds after, and so forth.
So if a malicious actor (possibly the user) makes the transaction with right gas at the right moment to be included in which slot, they can predict the block.timestamp

## Impact

The protocol is potentially rounding in favor of the user when the `poolState.debt` value is set. If a malicious actor decides to include all the `Pool.kick()` transations in favor of the user, the protocol may suffer loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rounding inside `Pool.kick` should be against the user to avoid exploits.
