High Severity Finding

# A proposal with more votes in the top ten list may end up getting removed in the screening process

## Summary
In the `_screeningVote`, there is a chance that a proposal which has received a higher number of votes can be removed from the `currentTopTenProposals` even though a proposal with a lower `votesReceived` exists.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the screening stage a list of possible winning projects is culled down to 10 candidates using a simple 1-token-1-vote method (as mentioned in GRANT_FUND.md).

In `_screeningVote`, three if-else conditions exist to check

- check if the proposal should be added to the top ten list for the first time
- proposal is already in the array
- proposal isn't already in the array

In the last check, the `votesReceived` at the last index in the array of `_proposals[currentTopTenProposals[screenedProposalsLength - 1]].votesReceived` is checked against the votes received of the current proposal.

Lets imagine a possible scenario,
**Note:** The `currentTopTenProposals` has not been sorted yet in the descending order.

- Lets say that the proposal at 5th position has 10 votes & the 10th position has 15 votes.
- Lets say the current proposal being voted in the `screeningVote` has 20 votes.
- `screeningVote` calls `_screeningVote(proposal, voter, votes)`. 
- According to the last else condition in `_screeningVote`, the current proposal having 20 votes replaces the proposal at the 10th position having 15 votes & enters into the top ten proposal list.
- And now the `currentTopTenProposals` is sorted by calling the `_insertionSortProposalsByVotes` function.
- However the proposal with less votes that is at 5th position still remains in the list.

```solidity
function _screeningVote(
        Proposal storage proposal_,
        VoterInfo storage voter_,
        uint256 votes_
    ) internal {

     ..........................

// check if the proposal should be added to the top ten list for the first time
        if (screenedProposalsLength < 10 && indexInArray == -1) {
            currentTopTenProposals.push(proposalId);

            // sort top ten proposals
            _insertionSortProposalsByVotes(currentTopTenProposals, screenedProposalsLength);
        }
        else {
            // proposal is already in the array
            if (indexInArray != -1) {
                // re-sort top ten proposals to account for new vote totals
                _insertionSortProposalsByVotes(currentTopTenProposals, uint256(indexInArray));
            }
            // proposal isn't already in the array
@audit-->>  else if (_proposals[currentTopTenProposals[screenedProposalsLength - 1]].votesReceived < proposal_.votesReceived) {
                // replace the least supported proposal with the new proposal
                currentTopTenProposals.pop();
                currentTopTenProposals.push(proposalId);

                // sort top ten proposals
                _insertionSortProposalsByVotes(currentTopTenProposals, screenedProposalsLength - 1);
            }
        }
```

## Impact
A proposal which has higher importance compared to some other proposals in the list may not end up making it to the funding stage & result in a loss of funds had the proposal that had been removed proposed a significant monetary/marketing/applicational benefit to the protocol/organization.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Sort the `currentTopTenProposals` prior to the if-else condition using `_insertionSortProposalsByVotes` function so that the least voted proposal might get replaced if the current proposal has more votes.
