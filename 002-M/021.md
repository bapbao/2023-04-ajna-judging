# It's impossible to unstake tokens if the rewards is more than Ajna balance

## Summary
In `RewardsManager.sol` we have `unstake()` function:
```solidity
    function unstake(
        uint256 tokenId_
    ) external override {
        _unstake({
            tokenId_:      tokenId_,
            claimRewards_: true
        });
    }
```

This function call internal `_unstake()` function, which is for unstake and claiming rewards. But It's impossible to unstake tokens if the reward is more than ajna tokens balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

When we decide to `unstake` tokens, this function call `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards()` to calculate the rewards:
```soldiity
779: if (claimRewards_) {
780:         rewardsEarned = _calculateAndClaimAllRewards(
```

The most important part for us is the end of the function when you have to send the rewards:
```solidity
        if (claimRewards_) {
            _transferAjnaRewards({
                transferAmount_: rewardsEarned,
                minAmount_:      rewardsEarned
            });
        }
```

Notice that `minAmount_` is hardcoded to exactly as many tokens as we need to get.
After this, we call `_transferAjnaRewards()`. This function transfer `Ajna` rewards to the sender:
```solidity
function _transferAjnaRewards(uint256 transferAmount_, uint256 minAmount_) internal {
        uint256 ajnaBalance = IERC20(ajnaToken).balanceOf(address(this));
  
        // cap amount to transfer at available contract balance
        if (transferAmount_ > ajnaBalance) transferAmount_ = ajnaBalance;
  
        // revert if amount to transfer is lower than limit amount
        if (transferAmount_ < minAmount_) revert InsufficientLiquidity();

        if (transferAmount_ != 0) {
            // transfer amount to rewards claimer
            IERC20(ajnaToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, transferAmount_);
        }
    }
```

Notice that if there is not enough balance, the reward we should get becomes the balance.
```solidity
828: if (transferAmount_ > ajnaBalance) transferAmount_ = ajnaBalance;
```

```solidity
831: if (transferAmount_ < minAmount_) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
```

But then it will always revert because `minAmount_` is hardcoded to `transferAmount_`.

Imagine the following situation:
- Alice has 1000 tokens and decides to unstake them.
- She calls `unstake()` and we get to the point where she has to send the rewards.
- Ajna's balance is 999 and this means that the rewards she gets become 999 and on the next `if` check the function reverts.
- Alice cannot unstake her tokens.

Yes, there is an option to use `emergencyUnstake()`, but that means you will lose the rewards every time, which is not fair.

## Impact

It is impossible for a user to unstake their tokens or have to use `emergencyUnstake()` and not get a reward.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of hardcoding `minAmount_: rewardsEarned`, you can do as you did in the `claimRewards()` function. Let the user choose `minAmount_`.
