# Users Would Lose Their Rewards in the Case where They call `unstake()` more than once within a Single Epoch


## Summary

The vulnerability is present in the reward distribution logic of the Ajna protocol where users who perform multiple unstaking/staking operations within the same epoch would face a silent loss of rewards. This flaw arises from the `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards` function's logic, which uses the `isEpochClaimed` mapping to identify whether rewards for a particular epoch have been claimed, disregarding any additional rewards accrued between the initial unstake and any subsequent unstaking operations within the same epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a conversation with the development team (attached at the end of the report), I confirmed that users can indeed call the `unstake()` function multiple times within a single epoch (each epoch can last for two weeks or more, depending on when it is started). This raised an alarm, given the implementation of the `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards` function.

The function [`_calculateAndClaimAllRewards` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L510-L546) forms the core of reward calculation and distribution logic in the [RewardsManager.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol) contract. When a user performs an unstake operation, this function is invoked, which uses the `isEpochClaimed` mapping to verify if the rewards for that epoch have already been claimed. If so, the function silently skips the reward calculation process for that epoch. This design flaw can lead to a scenario where a user unstakes, stakes again, and then unstakes within the same epoch, leading to the user not receiving any rewards that they may have accrued during the period after their first unstake and before their second unstake.

Note that the call to `unstake()` from the user triggers the internal `_unstake()` function, which in turn calls `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards`.

For brevity reasons I'd attach only the codeblock of the [`_calculateAndClaimAllRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L510-L546) in report

```solidity
    function _calculateAndClaimAllRewards(
        StakeInfo storage stakeInfo_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 epochToClaim_,
        bool validateEpoch_,
        address ajnaPool_
    ) internal returns (uint256 rewardsEarned_) {


        // revert if higher epoch to claim than current burn epoch
        if (validateEpoch_ && epochToClaim_ > IPool(ajnaPool_).currentBurnEpoch()) revert EpochNotAvailable();


        // update bucket exchange rates and claim associated rewards
        rewardsEarned_ = _updateBucketExchangeRates(
            ajnaPool_,
            positionManager.getPositionIndexes(tokenId_)
        );


        if (!isEpochClaimed[tokenId_][epochToClaim_]) {
            rewardsEarned_ += _calculateAndClaimStakingRewards(tokenId_, epochToClaim_);
        }


        uint256[] memory burnEpochsClaimed = _getBurnEpochsClaimed(
            stakeInfo_.lastClaimedEpoch,
            epochToClaim_
        );


        emit ClaimRewards(
            msg.sender,
            ajnaPool_,
            tokenId_,
            burnEpochsClaimed,
            rewardsEarned_
        );


        // update last interaction burn event
        stakeInfo_.lastClaimedEpoch = uint96(epochToClaim_);
    }
```

The critical part of the `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards_` function that leads to this issue is this conditional check:

```solidity
if (!isEpochClaimed[tokenId_][epochToClaim_]) {
    rewardsEarned_ += _calculateAndClaimStakingRewards(tokenId_, epochToClaim_);
}
```

Here, the function checks if rewards for a particular epoch have already been claimed by a user. If the rewards have been claimed once, the function will not calculate any further rewards for the same epoch even if the user performed additional staking operations in the same epoch. This creates a silent loss of rewards for users who perform multiple unstake operations within the same epoch.

This issue could lead to significant financial losses for users engaging in multiple staking and unstaking operations within the same epoch, and given the likelihood of this happening in an active DeFi ecosystem (chances of this happening is massively increased with the fact that an epoch could last as long as 2 weeks or even longer), this warrants a high severity finding.

## Impact

The impact of this flaw is substantial as it can lead to significant financial losses for users. Users may lose out on the rewards that they should have earned between their first and second unstake operations within a single epoch. Given that epochs can span weeks, the financial impact could be significant, especially for users with a large number of tokens staked. This impact justifies the classification of this vulnerability as high severity.

## Code Snippet

The code where the issue resides is the [`_calculateAndClaimAllRewards` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L510-L546), [unstake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L216-L223) & [`_unstake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L770-L814)

## Recommendation

Hard recommendation to make but an idea could be to modify the `isEpochClaimed` mapping. Instead of it being a boolean flag, it should keep track of the total rewards claimed by a user in each epoch. With this data, the contract can calculate the difference between the total rewards available and the total rewards already claimed, ensuring that users receive their rightful rewards even if they unstake multiple times within the same epoch.

Here's a rough sketch of the proposed changes:

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private rewardsClaimed; // tokenId -> epoch -> total rewards claimed so far

// in the _calculateAndClaimAllRewards function:
uint256 totalRewards = _calculateTotalRewards(tokenId_, epochToClaim_);
uint256 claimedRewards = rewardsClaimed[tokenId_][epochToClaim_];
if (claimedRewards < totalRewards) {
    uint256 newRewards = totalRewards - claimedRewards;
    rewardsEarned_ += newRewards;
    rewardsClaimed[tokenId_][epochToClaim_] += newRewards;
}
```

Note that the `_calculateTotalRewards` function mentioned above is a hypothetical function that would be added to calculate the total rewards that should be available for a user for a particular epoch.

Nevertheless, the addition of this logic will introduce more complexity into the code and could potentially increase gas costs due to the additional storage operations and computations.

Lastly, the `isEpochClaimed` mapping was introduced into the `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards` to prevent a vulnerability where a user could claim rewards they've already claimed in the former `moveStakedLiquidity()` function. I believe the recommended fix also curbs this as if a user already claimed all their rewards they wouldn't have any rewards to reclaim.

### **Discussion: Possible issue with `unstake()` and `calculateAndClaimAllRewards()` in RewardsManager**

#### **Context:**

The possibility to call the `unstake()` function more than once in a particular epoch was discussed in the context of the ongoing Ajna contest on Sherlock.

**Query:**

> Hi dizzy, I wanted to ask a question about the ongoing Ajna contest on Sherlock, is it possible to call the `unstake()` function more than once in a particular epoch?

**Reply:**

> Hey! Yeah, it should be possible as long as you stake, unstake, stake and so on. An epoch can be 2 weeks or more, it depends on when it is started. (See [KickerActions.sol#L300](https://github.com/ajna-finance/contracts/blob/develop/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L300))
> So if enough reserves one could kick / start an epoch, then at least 2 weeks should pass (and enough reserves to accumulate) in order for the next one to start.

**Follow-up Query:**

> So if it's possible to unstake more than once in an epoch, doesn't that mean that users lose on their consequent rewards the next time they call `unstake()` since this check from `calculateAndClaimAllRewards()` would cause a silent pass on calculating the `rewardsEarned`?

```solidity
if (!isEpochClaimed[tokenId][epochToClaim]) {
    rewardsEarned += calculateAndClaimStakingRewards(tokenId, epochToClaim_);
}
```

**Reply:**

> You're correct, if they unstake, then stake again they won't be able to get rewards from the same epoch but only for other.

### Further Discussions

**Team Query:**

> So a fix would be to delete isEpochClaimed mapping when unstake, is this your suggested fix?

**My Reply:**

> Can't really wrap my head around an exact fix atm, an idea could be that in an instance of multiple calls to unstake in the same epoch, the protocol could keep track of the last time rewards were claimed/unstake was called and then only forward the rewards gotten from that time, I think that could be a good foundation to build on, cause i don't think deleting the mapping exactly solves this issue.
