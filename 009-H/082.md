# Pool's kickWithDeposit misses liquidation debt check

## Summary

_revertIfAuctionDebtLocked() is missed in kickWithDeposit() function, that can actually remove deposit from anywhere, including HPB that are frozen by liquidation debt accumulator.

## Vulnerability Detail

The inability to remove quote token deposit that is placed high enough to be covered by liquidation debt accumulator is a part of system design (see `7.5 Liquidation Debt` of Ajna protocol white paper).

The corresponding check is performed by _revertIfAuctionDebtLocked() in moveQuoteToken() and removeQuoteToken(), but is missed in kickWithDeposit() that allows for quote funds retrieval from HPB as well.

## Impact

HPB depositors can use `kickWithDeposit() -> withdrawBonds()` for quote funds removal, effectively avoiding liquidation debt controls, which can lead to deposit shortage for the matters of eventual bad debt coverage. I.e. in some situations when depositor knows that his funds are about to be used to cover bad debt it might be reasonably for them to use kickWithDeposit() even knowing that there most probably will be a kicker penalty imposed.

This not only can create a number of bad faith auctions, but can move a burden of debt write offs to lower bucket depositors, who are unaware of such possibility and do not actively monitor pool state. This will allow HPB depositors to obtain stable yield, but off load a part of the corresponding risks, profiting off the lower buckets depositors (who, in general, pocketed a somewhat lower yield, but receive more risk this way).

As there is no low-probability prerequisites and the impact is a violation of system design allowing one group of users to profit off another, setting the severity to be high.

## Code Snippet

kickWithDeposit() can effectively remove quote tokens from any bucket to cover kick bond, but is not controlled for liquidation debt buffer:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L321-L336

```solidity
    function kickWithDeposit(
        uint256 index_,
        uint256 npLimitIndex_
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

        // kick auctions
        KickResult memory result = KickerActions.kickWithDeposit(
            auctions,
            deposits,
            buckets,
            loans,
            poolState,
            index_,
            npLimitIndex_
        );
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L149-L243

```solidity
    function kickWithDeposit(
        ...
    ) external returns (
        KickResult memory kickResult_
    ) {
        ...

        // kick top borrower
        kickResult_ = _kick(
            ...
        );

        // amount to remove from deposit covers entire bond amount
        if (vars.amountToDebitFromDeposit > kickResult_.amountToCoverBond) {
            // cap amount to remove from deposit at amount to cover bond
            vars.amountToDebitFromDeposit = kickResult_.amountToCoverBond;

            // recalculate the LUP with the amount to cover bond
            kickResult_.lup = Deposits.getLup(deposits_, poolState_.debt + vars.amountToDebitFromDeposit);
            // entire bond is covered from deposit, no additional amount to be send by lender
            kickResult_.amountToCoverBond = 0;
        } else {
            // lender should send additional amount to cover bond
            kickResult_.amountToCoverBond -= vars.amountToDebitFromDeposit;
        }

        // revert if the bucket price used to kick and remove is below new LUP
        if (vars.bucketPrice < kickResult_.lup) revert PriceBelowLUP();

        // remove amount from deposits
        if (vars.amountToDebitFromDeposit == vars.bucketDeposit && vars.bucketCollateral == 0) {
            // In this case we are redeeming the entire bucket exactly, and need to ensure bucket LP are set to 0
            vars.redeemedLP = vars.bucketLP;

>>          Deposits.unscaledRemove(deposits_, index_, vars.bucketUnscaledDeposit);
            vars.bucketUnscaledDeposit = 0;

        } else {
            ...

>>          Deposits.unscaledRemove(deposits_, index_, unscaledAmountToRemove);
            vars.bucketUnscaledDeposit -= unscaledAmountToRemove;
        }
```

_revertIfAuctionDebtLocked() is guarding direct quote funds removal via moveQuoteToken(): 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L176-L185

```solidity
    function moveQuoteToken(
        uint256 maxAmount_,
        uint256 fromIndex_,
        uint256 toIndex_,
        uint256 expiry_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 fromBucketLP_, uint256 toBucketLP_, uint256 movedAmount_) {
        _revertAfterExpiry(expiry_);
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

>>      _revertIfAuctionDebtLocked(deposits, poolState.t0DebtInAuction, fromIndex_, poolState.inflator);
```

And removeQuoteToken():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L210-L218

```solidity
    function removeQuoteToken(
        uint256 maxAmount_,
        uint256 index_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 removedAmount_, uint256 redeemedLP_) {
        _revertIfAuctionClearable(auctions, loans);

        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();

>>      _revertIfAuctionDebtLocked(deposits, poolState.t0DebtInAuction, index_, poolState.inflator);
```

## Recommendation

Consider adding the check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L321-L336

```diff
    function kickWithDeposit(
        uint256 index_,
        uint256 npLimitIndex_
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        PoolState memory poolState = _accruePoolInterest();
+       _revertIfAuctionDebtLocked(deposits, poolState.t0DebtInAuction, index_, poolState.inflator);

        // kick auctions
        KickResult memory result = KickerActions.kickWithDeposit(
            auctions,
            deposits,
            buckets,
            loans,
            poolState,
            index_,
            npLimitIndex_
        );
```
