# Nonce is not incremented, leading to signature replay

## Summary
non-incrementing nonce can lead to signature re use
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function permit(
        address spender_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 deadline_,
        bytes memory signature_
    ) external {
        // check that the permit's deadline hasn't passed
        if (block.timestamp > deadline_) revert PermitExpired();

        // calculate signature digest
        bytes32 digest = _buildDigest(
            // owner,
            spender_,
            tokenId_,
            _nonces[tokenId_],
            deadline_
        );

        // check the address recovered from the signature matches the spender
        (address recoveredAddress, ) = ECDSA.tryRecover(digest, signature_);
        if (!_checkSignature(digest, signature_, recoveredAddress, tokenId_)) revert NotAuthorized();

        // approve the spender for accessing the tokenId
        _approve(spender_, tokenId_);
    }
```
The problem originates in the `permit` function. The problem here is that the nonce is never incremented/ there are no checks that validate the nonce of the tx. The issue with this is that because the nonce is never considered, an attacker can look through the blockchain to find an old approval function from a non suspecting user, and replay his signature to do malicious things, such as steal his tokens.
below is a short POC that details how a malicious user can exploit this.

1. the nonce is not incremented, this then opens the door for sign replay attack
2. suppose user A signs a signature, then calls permit function to approve a spender
3. the user A then decides to revoke this approval in a later tx
4. The signature deadline is not passed, anyone can replay his approval
5. user A approval is replayed, user A can replay the signature to recover the allowance from the spender even after the user revoke approval
6. another user is able to steal his funds even though the primary user intended to revoke this approval.
## Impact
user A may change his mind about approval, because the nonce in the function does not increment. A malicious user can replay his signature to essentially steal his funds or assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend the protocol adds logic to the `permit` function so that signature replay is not possible.
