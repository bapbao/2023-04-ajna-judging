# PositionManager & PermitERC721 do not comply with EIP-4494

## Summary

The [Scope Q&A](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna#q-is-the-codecontract-expected-to-comply-with-any-eips-are-there-specific-assumptions-around-adhering-to-those-eips-that-watsons-should-be-aware-of) explicitly stated an expectation for the contract/code under inspection to comply with EIP-4494. However, the `PermitERC721` and `PositionManager` contracts do not satisfy the requirements of the EIP-4494 standard. Specifically, they lack the implementation of the IERC165 interface and do not indicate support for the 0x5604e225 interface. These discrepancies, mark the contracts as non-compliant with the EIP-4494 standard, which could lead to potential interoperability issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [PermitERC721](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/base/PermitERC721.sol#L1-L50) and [PositionManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L1-L40) contracts have not been implemented according to the specifications of the [EIP-4494](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4494) standard. They lack the crucial implementation of the IERC165 interface and do not support the 0x5604e225 interface, both of which are mandatory according to the EIP-4494 standard... quoting the EIP:
_This EIP requires EIP-165. EIP165 is already required in ERC-721, but is further necessary here in order to register the interface of this EIP. Doing so will allow easy verification if an NFT contract has implemented this EIP or not, enabling them to interact accordingly. The interface of this EIP (as defined in EIP-165) is 0x5604e225. Contracts implementing this EIP MUST have the supportsInterface function return true when called with 0x5604e225._

## Impact

The absence of the IERC165 implementation and lack of support for the 0x5604e225 interface in accordance with the EIP-4494 standard have several potential implications:

1. The `PositionManager` & `PermitERC721` contracts **do not comply with the EIP-4494 standard**.
2. This discrepancy could hamper the contracts' interoperability with other systems and smart contracts, as third-party contracts would be unable to identify their adherence to the `EIP-4494` standard.

## Code Snippet

[PermitERC721](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/base/PermitERC721.sol#L1-L50) and [PositionManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L1-L40)

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

To fully comply with the EIP-4494 standard, both the `PermitERC721` and `PositionManager` contracts must implement the IERC165 interface and declare their support for the 0x5604e225 interface. This necessary adjustment will resolve the non-compliance and ensure smooth interoperability with other systems and smart contracts.
