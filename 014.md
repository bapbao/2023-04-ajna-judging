# XO-`_checkTokenIdSortOrder` Function in `ERC721PoolFactory` Does Not Check for Duplicate Token `IDs`

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `_checkTokenIdSortOrder` function. This function is responsible for checking that the array of token `IDs` is sorted in ascending order, the function does not check for duplicate token `IDs.` This means that an attacker could create a pool with duplicate token IDs, which would allow them to exploit the pool and steal funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity
  */
    function _checkTokenIdSortOrder(uint256[] memory tokenIds_) internal pure {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length - 1; ) {
            if (tokenIds_[i] >= tokenIds_[i + 1]) revert TokenIdSubsetInvalid();
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the  `ERC721PoolFactory` contract in the `_checkTokenIdSortOrder` Function, so the problem is that is  the `_checkTokenIdSortOrder()` function iterates over the array of token `IDs,` comparing each token `ID` to the next token `ID.` If the current token `ID` is greater than or `equal` to the next token `ID,` the function reverts, and  the function does not check for `duplicate` token IDs, means that an attacker could create a pool with `duplicate` token `IDs,` such as `[1, 1, 2]`. The `_checkTokenIdSortOrder()` function would not detect this, and the pool would be created successfully.
- and once the pool is created, the attacker could then deposit funds into the pool. The attacker could then withdraw the funds, and the pool would not be able to distinguish between the duplicate token `IDs.` This would allow the attacker to steal funds from the pool.
## Impact
- This vulnerability could exploit by an attacker an leading to steal funds from the pool and The attacker could do this by creating a pool with duplicate token IDs and then depositing funds into the pool. The attacker could then withdraw the funds, and the pool would not be able to distinguish between the duplicate token IDs. This would allow the attacker to steal funds from the pool.

## Recommendation
-  add a check for duplicate token IDs to the `_checkTokenIdSortOrder` function
