# NFTs can be permanently locked or frozen if transferred to non-implemented onERC721Received support contract address(Missing issue in docs)

First of all before going deep in below report, I had a detail discussion with sponsors in discord private chat and the issue is confirmed with some agreed solution which is mentioned in recommendations and agreed for a fix by sponsors.

## Summary
NFTs can be permanently locked or frozen if transferred to non-implemented onERC721Received support contract address. Use ERC721.saferTransferFrom instead of ERC721.transferFrom when you send out NFT

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In ERC721Pool.sol contract, _transferNFT(..) function has used ERC721 transferFrom() to transfer the NFT to recepient. Which is shown as below,

```solidity
File: src/ERC721Pool.sol

622    function _transferNFT(address from_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_) internal {
623        // slither-disable-next-line calls-loop
624        IERC721Token(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).transferFrom(from_, to_, tokenId_);
625    }
```

_transferNFT() function is further used in _transferFromPoolToAddress() function which is given as below,

```solidity
File: src/ERC721Pool.sol

592    function _transferFromPoolToAddress(
593        address toAddress_,
594       uint256[] storage poolTokens_,
595        uint256 amountToRemove_
596    ) internal returns (uint256[] memory) {
597        uint256[] memory tokensTransferred = new uint256[](amountToRemove_);
598
599        uint256 noOfNFTsInPool = poolTokens_.length;
600
601        for (uint256 i = 0; i < amountToRemove_;) {
602            uint256 tokenId = poolTokens_[--noOfNFTsInPool]; // start with transferring the last token added in bucket
603            poolTokens_.pop();
604
605            _transferNFT(address(this), toAddress_, tokenId);
606
607            tokensTransferred[i] = tokenId;
608
609            unchecked { ++i; }
610        }
611
612        return tokensTransferred;
613    }
```

As seen above at L-624, transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(). I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

The issue is if the recepient is a contract address, the NFT will be locked or frozen because of NO checkOnERC721Received support in current implementation.

Openzeppelin encourages to use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom and in ER721.sol, the comment says,

```solidity
File: contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol

180     * @dev Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
181     * are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.


193     * - If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.
```

OpenZeppelin’s documentation discourages the use of transferFrom(), Use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible,

Openzeppelin warns of using transfer( ) by saying,

"Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC721 or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of safeTransferFrom prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability."

Also, As per the documentation of EIP-721:

```solidity

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.
```

**Discussion with Sponsors(@dizzy):**
I had a detail discussion on safeTransferFrom() use instead of transferFrom() in _transferNFT() at L-624. I explained the impact of not using transferFrom() function which with current implementation will lock the user NFTs if it is transferred to contract address. It was also discussed the scenario after account abstraction will fully rollout where smart contracts will handle as account. While discussion, it was said the contracts will be used by some already deployed proxy contract. This proxy contract holds tokens. Inshort the contracts will used via. proxy contracts. Now the issue is the proxy contract does not implement the onERC721Received support which for sure wont be able to receive the NFTs and if the NFTs sent to contract address with NO onERC721Received support will lock or freeze the NFTs permanently. It also does not seems to be possible for redeployment of proxy contract to mitigate the issue. After all Pros and Cons, It was decided to go with current implementation only but these critical issues are NOT documented anywhere. These critical issue are not aware to users and integrators.

Please be noted Ajna 1st Sherlock contest had used safeTransferFrom() but later after discussion with integrators, It had to purposely use transferFrom() to allow integrators use their existing contracts / proxies.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom and Follow Checks-Effect-interaction pattern. But as per the detail discussion on this topic, this does not seems to be possible presently.
2) As discussed and agreed, Kindly mention these critical issues clearly in documentation for USERS as well as for INTEGRATORS to make sure their contracts support the NFT and they are not end up locked NFTs in their contracts.
3) Make a clear documents stating above issues pertaining to transfer of NFTs to contract addresses, also alert users the impact of transferring the NFT to contract address at Front-end user interface(UI).
