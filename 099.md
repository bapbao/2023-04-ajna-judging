# Accounting issues leading to potential loss of user rewards

## Summary

There are a couple of issues in `RewardsManager.sol` with the accounting of claimed rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are 2 cases in `RewardsManager.sol` where the function `RewardsManager._transferAjnaRewards` is called with a value of 0 for the `minAmount_` param.

1. Inside the function `updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L257-L259

2. Inside the function `stake`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L202-L204

When a user calls one of these 2 functions it can happen that the protocol transfers less ajnaToken to the user. Because `_transferAjnaRewards()` which is called to transfer the rewarded ajnaToken to the user sets the `transferAmount_` equal to the protocol's `ajnaBalance`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L828

If the balance of ajna is smaller than the amount to transfer, the user will receive less rewards than they should receive.

Note that the protocol tries to mitigate this by checking whether the `transferAmount_` is smaller than the `minAmount_`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L831

But as shown above, the functions `stake` and `updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim` are calling `_transferAjnaRewards()` with a value of 0 for the `minAmount_` param, which means that the protocol doesn't revert if the amount of tokens to transfer to the user is smaller than the available tokens. So the protocol will transfer less ajnaToken than it should to the user.

Yet, the protocol's accounting logic potentially tracks that the user received all rewards, because both `stake()` and `updateBucketExchangeRatesAndClaim()` are calling `_updateBucketExchangeRates()` to determine the reward for the user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L196

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L254

Inside `_updateBucketExchangeRates` the rewards that are supposed to be transferred to the user (tracked via the variable `updatedRewards_`) are added to `updateRewardsClaimed`, with the assumption that all of these rewards are going to be transferred to the user, which is a false assumption and leads to the accounting issues:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L677

Because if `updateRewardsClaimed` is always adding the full amount of rewards to be transferred, yet in reality the protocol does not transfer the full amount of rewards in the case described above where the token balance is not sufficient, the accounting is wrong and is potentially accounting more rewards that the user claimed than what was in reality transferred to the user.

This leaves the user incapable of claiming the remaining amount of rewards that were not transferred to them, because the protocol accounting (`updateRewardsClaimed`) already tracked that all rewards were transferred to the user despite that this may not be true.

#### A very similar issue:

An additional very similar issue exists in the codebase, where the user themselves have to specify the `minAmount_` of ajnaToken to receice when calling `claimRewards()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L120-L123

Here it can also happen that the `minAmount_` is below the amount that the user should receive, and `updateRewardsClaimed` will still track the full amount of the user's rewards, despite that the user never received the full amount of rewards due to insufficient ajnaToken balance of the protocol. Thus again the user's claimed rewards is wrongly tracked by the protocol. With the consequence that users can't claim unclaimed rewards later, because they are considered to be already claimed due to the accounting issues.


## Impact

The protocol potentially transfers less Ajna (ajnaToken) rewards to the user compared to what they should receive, and the user doesn't have the option to claim unclaimed rewards later due to accounting issues in the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either consider updating `updateRewardsClaimed` (line 677 RewardsManager.sol) only with the value that was actually transferred to the user.

Or revert when the ajna token balance is not sufficient, by setting `minAmount_` to the same as the rewards to be transferred to the user.
