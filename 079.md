# ERC721 tokens will be locked forever due to usage of transferFrom

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _transferNFT uses transferFrom() method instead of safeTransferFrom which is discouraged by  OpenZeppelin( https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256- ).

## Impact

transferFrom() can result in loss of NFT if the SC address is not able to handle the received NFT.

There are a few NFTs that have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom().

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using safeTransferFrom over transferFrom when exercising. safeTransferFrom ensures address is capable of handling ERC721 NFTs.
