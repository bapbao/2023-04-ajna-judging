# XO-`transferFromWithPermit` function allows attackers to steal `tokens`

## Summary
- The `transferFromWithPermit` function does not check to make sure that the third party is actually authorized to transfer the tokens.
- This means that an attacker could call the permit function with a fake signature, and then call the `transferFromWithPermit` function to transfer the tokens to themselves.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity
function transferFromWithPermit(
        address from_, address to_, address spender_, uint256 value_, uint256 deadline_, uint8 v_, bytes32 r_, bytes32 s_
    ) external {
        permit(from_, spender_, value_, deadline_, v_, r_, s_);
        transferFrom(from_, to_, value_);
    }
}
```
There is a vulnerability in the `transferFromWithPermit` function. this function can  calls the permit function, this operation can allows a third party to transfer tokens on behalf of the owner of the tokens so we have  the `transferFromWithPermit` function does not check to make sure that the third party is actually authorized to transfer the tokens. This means that an attacker can call the permit function with a fake signature, and then call the `transferFromWithPermit` function to transfer the tokens to his account. This problem can allow an attacker to steal tokens from the contract.
## Impact
- the vulnerability allow an attacker to steal tokens from the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding a check to the `transferFromWithPermit` function to make sure that the signature of the permit function is valid.
