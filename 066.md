# XO-`MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT` event does not specify the `index` of the `bucket` from which the `collateral` was merged.

## Summary
- the `event` does not specify the `index` of the `bucket` from which `the` collateral was merged, this means that an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by merging collateral from one bucket to another, without the knowledge of the bucket's owner.
## Vulnerability Detail

- There is a vulnerability in the `MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT` event:
```solidity
 /**
     *  @notice Emitted when actor adds claimable collateral to a bucket.
     *  @param  actor            Recipient that added collateral.
     *  @param  collateralMerged Amount of collateral merged (`WAD` precision).
     *  @param  toIndexLps       If non-zero, amount of LP in toIndex when collateral is merged into bucket (`WAD` precision). If 0, no collateral is merged.
     */
    event MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT(
        address indexed actor,
        uint256 collateralMerged,
        uint256 toIndexLps
    );

    /**
     *  @notice Emitted when borrower draws debt from the pool or adds collateral to the pool.
     *  @param  borrower          `msg.sender`.
     *  @param  amountBorrowed    Amount of quote tokens borrowed from the pool (`WAD` precision).
     *  @param  tokenIdsPledged   Array of tokenIds to be added to the pool.
     *  @param  lup               LUP after borrow.
     */
```
 - so the problem is we have the `MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT` event is emitted when an actor merges or removes collateral from a bucket. The event does not specify the index of the bucket from which the collateral was merged. this means that an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by merging collateral from one bucket to another, without the knowledge of the bucket's owner.
## Impact
- if an attacker expolit this vulnerability it's can lead to steal tokens from the pool. here is an example, 
- let's say that there are two buckets, Bucket A and Bucket B. Bucket A contains 100 tokens, and Bucket B contains 0 tokens. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by merging 50 tokens from Bucket A to Bucket B. The `MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT` event would be emitted, but it would not specify the index of the bucket from which the collateral was merged. This means that the owner of Bucket A would not know that their collateral had been merged to Bucket B.
- The attacker could then use the tokens in Bucket B to borrow money from the pool. The pool would not know that the attacker did not own the tokens in Bucket B, because the `MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT` event did not specify the index of the bucket from which the collateral was merged.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
-  the `MergeOrRemoveCollateralNFT` event should be `updated` to specify the `index` of the `bucket` from which the `collateral` was merged.
