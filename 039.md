# Lose of unclaimed rewards in case a bucket goes bankrupt

## Summary

Lose of unclaimed rewards in case a bucket goes bankrupt

## Vulnerability Detail

When the lender calls PositionManager.memorializePositions method

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/e2439305cc093204a0d927aac19d898f4a0edb3d/ajna-core/src/PositionManager.sol#L236

if the bucket goes bucket, the lps is zero out

```solidity
// check for previous deposits
 	if (position.depositTime != 0) {
 		// check that bucket didn't go bankrupt after prior memorialization
 		if (_bucketBankruptAfterDeposit(pool, index, position.depositTime)) {
 			// if bucket did go bankrupt, zero out the LP tracked by position manager
 			position.lps = 0;
 		}
 	}
```

However, the lender could still have unclaimed rewards. In this case, the lender loses the rewards due to the lack of claiming rewards before zeroing out the previous tracked LP balance.

In RewardsManager, claimRewards there is no a check for bucket's bankruptcy.
