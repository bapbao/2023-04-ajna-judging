# Users can claim rewards for past epochs at any time, even after a long period has passed since the epoch ended.

## Summary
There is no mechanism to ensure that the claims for rewards are made within a specific time frame or epoch due to the absence of an event-based timestamp validation
## Vulnerability Detail
It allows participants to manipulate the order of events or submit events with arbitrary timestamps, potentially impacting the correctness and fairness of the reward distribution process.
## Impact
Rewards are inflated and unfairly distributed which leads to  incorrect calculations and potential loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add timestamp validation mechanisms in contracts that handle reward distributions. These mechanisms will enforce time limits for claiming rewards or define specific epochs during which rewards can be claimed. An implementation example is in the Code Snippet.
