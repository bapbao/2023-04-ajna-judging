# Incorrect rounding of collateralAmount in take() function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
According openzeppelin's docs for the construction of ERC721 tokens, it is stated that " unlike ERC20, ERC721 lacks a decimals field, since each token is distinct and cannot be partitioned." you'll see that here --https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721#constructing_an_erc721_token_contract

But in the take() function in ERC721Pool.sol,  when _transferFromPoolToAddress() is called, the function divides `result.collateralAmount`  which is the collateral amount to send to taker by 1e18 

```solidity
  // transfer rounded collateral from pool to taker
        uint256[] memory tokensTaken = _transferFromPoolToAddress(
            callee_,
            borrowerTokenIds[borrowerAddress_],
            result.collateralAmount / 1e18
        );
```

Since ERC721 tokens lacks a decimal field this will result in sending miscalculated and incorrect collateral amount to taker.

## Impact
miscalculated and incorrect collateral amount will be sent to taker

Manual Review

## Recommendation
since ERC721 tokens lacks a decimal field maybe don't divide by 1e18
