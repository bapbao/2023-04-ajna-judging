# transferFromWithPermit not callable by token owner

## Summary
In the ```AjnaToken.sol``` there is a ```transferFromWithPermit``` which handles transfers using the erc20 permit functionality. But this is function does not follow the natspec above it.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity

//@audit-issue token owner cannot call this function, only spender can 
    /**
     *  @notice Called by an owner of AJNA tokens to enable their tokens to be transferred by a spender address without making a seperate permit call
     *  @param  from_     The address of the current owner of the tokens
     *  @param  to_       The address of the new owner of the tokens
     *  @param  spender_  The address of the third party who will execute the transaction involving an owners tokens
     *  @param  value_    The amount of tokens to transfer
     *  @param  deadline_ The unix timestamp by which the permit must be called
     *  @param  v_        Component of secp256k1 signature
     *  @param  r_        Component of secp256k1 signature
     *  @param  s_        Component of secp256k1 signature
     */
    function transferFromWithPermit(
        address from_, address to_, address spender_, uint256 value_, uint256 deadline_, uint8 v_, bytes32 r_, bytes32 s_
    ) external {
        permit(from_, spender_, value_, deadline_, v_, r_, s_);
        transferFrom(from_, to_, value_);
    }
```
according to the code comment, a token owner  calls this function, but from the code, the permit function verifies the secp256k1 signature then approves the spender, then calls transferFrom. 
If a token owner calls the function, they will approve an arbitrary spender's address, and transferFrom their balance IF they have approved their own address, but this does not decrease the spender's allowance. 
## Impact
Approval of spender address, making transfer and not decreasing spender's allowance.
Also the function would revert if the owner does give themselves allowance

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict token owners from calling this function by adding
```solidity
require(from != spender);
```
