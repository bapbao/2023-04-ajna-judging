# Hardcoded `ajnaTokenAddress ` in Storage.sol used in grant coordination only exists on mainnet, it won't exist or be the same on other L2 chains like polygon e.t.c

## Summary
Hardcoded Addresses on multichain projects normally cause issues because the address may not exist or be the same on another chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
The hardcoded `ajnaTokenAddress ` in Storage.sol may not be the same address or it doesn't even exist on other chains. 

## Impact
This will break some functions in the `GrantFund.sol` contract as the hardcoded `ajnaTokenAddress ` in Storage.sol is used in grant coordination.

it is used in functions like `fundTreasury()`, `claimDelegateReward()` for sending funds
