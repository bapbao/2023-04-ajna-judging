# `Math.wmul` may misbehave and revert on edge cases, even if the result is within the bound.

## Summary
`Math.wmul` may revert on, even if the result is within the bound.

## Vulnerability Detail
The edge case would be for example, when `x = 2^128 - 1` and `y = 2^128+1` , so `x * y + WAD / 2` will lead to `uint256` overflow. However, the actual result should be equal to `2^256 / WAD + 1` (which is a valid value). 

## Impact
The implementation of `wmul` in the library currently doesn't cover all edge cases, which is an unexpected behavior for the base library.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Update the implementation so that it can do full multiplication and cover all edge cases. For example, use the following implementation `mulDiv`:

*(and just add 1 if the remainder of `(x mod WAD) * (y mod WAD)` is >= `WAD / 2` for the same rounding behavior.
