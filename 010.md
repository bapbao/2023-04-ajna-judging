# [H-01] Restrictive equality check in `PositionManager.moveLiquidity()` can potentially unfairly not allow liquidity holders move liquidity

## Summary
Restrictive equality check in `PositionManager.moveLiquidity()` can potentially unfairly not allow liquidity holders to move liquidity

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
if (vars.fromLP != vars.lpbAmountFrom) revert RemovePositionFailed(); // bucket has collateral and quote therefore LP is not redeemable for full quote token amount
```

Since amount of liquidity token to move calculated is dependent on amount of deposit, claimable collateral and total lpb tokens in pool, it is very unlikely that the initial LP amount moved from position memorialized to NFT recorded at time of deposit will be always equal to lp token to move at time of moving after swap based on current bucket exchange rate in pool. This can result in 2 scenarios:

1. If fromlp determined to move via `moveQuoteToken()` is lesser than the original amount of lpToken tied to NFT, user cannot move liquidity to another bucket

2. If fromlp determined to move via `moveQuoteToken()` is more than the original amount of lpToken tied to NFT, user will be unfairly not allowed to move liquidity.

The above check mentioned could be too restrictive since deposits and claimable collateral along with amount of lp tokens in pool can change anytime and as such bucket exchange rates will not remain constant. Or it could simply be due to the fact that bucket still has collateral and quote token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The above check is not required since collateral, deposits and lpb will be updated accordingly via `moveQuoteToken()`.

However, since we cannot guarantee that the lp tokens to move out will always be equal to original lp balance memorialized to NFT, perhaps a slippage parameter could be introduced since a swap is involved when moving liquidity, that allows revert if lp amount to move from old bucket to new bucket does not meet minimum amount.
