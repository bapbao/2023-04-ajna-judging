# XO-`tokenIds` parameter in `atomicSwapCallback()` function is not properly `validated`

## Summary
- The `atomicSwapCallback()` function does not check to make sure that the `tokenIds` parameter is a valid array of `NFT` token `IDs,` this can allow an attacker to transfer the `NFTs` even though the attacker does not own the `NFTs`.
## Vulnerability Detail
- There is a vulnerability in the interface `IERC721Taker`, it is in the `atomicSwapCallback(` function,
```solidity
function atomicSwapCallback(
        uint256[] memory tokenIds, 
        uint256          quoteAmountDue,
        bytes calldata   data
    ) external;
}
```
- so the problem is that the function does not check to make sure that the `tokenIds` parameter is a valid array of `NFT` token IDs. means that an attacker could call the `atomicSwapCallback()` function with a value for the `tokenIds` parameter that is not a valid array of `NFT` token `IDs.` This would cause the function to transfer the `NFTs` to the attacker, even though the attacker does not own the `NFTs.`
## Impact
-  This vulnerability allow an attacker to transfer the `NFTs` even though the attacker does not own the `NFTs.`
-  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability:
    - An attacker  create a malicious contract that calls the `atomicSwapCallback()` function.
    - an attacker  set the `tokenIds` parameter to an array of `NFT` token `IDs` that the attacker does not own.
    - an attacker call the `atomicSwapCallback()` function with the malicious contract.
    - The contract  transfer the `NFTs` to the attacker, even though the attacker does not own the `NFTs.`

## Recommendation
- adding a check to the `atomicSwapCallback()` function to ensure that the `tokenIds` parameter is a valid array of `NFT` token `IDs.`
