# XO-`atomicSwapCallback()` function does not check for empty `data` parameter Severity: High

## Summary
- The vulnerability cause a problem that  The `atomicSwapCallback()` function does not check for an empty data parameter. This means that an attacker can pass in an empty data parameter, which will cause the `atomicSwapCallback()` function to revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 */
    function atomicSwapCallback(
        uint256        collateralAmount, 
        uint256        quoteAmountDue,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external;
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `atomicSwapCallback()` function in the `IERC20Taker` interface, the problem is that the funvtion does not check to see if the data parameter is empty so this means that an attacker can pass in an empty data parameter, which will cause the `atomicSwapCallback()` function to revert and can this vulnerability allows an attacker  to disrupt the operation of the smart contract or to prevent the taker from receiving the quote token.
## Impact
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disrupt the operation of the smart contract or to prevent the taker from receiving the quote token.
- An attacker could create a malicious contract that implements the `IERC20Taker` interface. The malicious contract would then call the `atomicSwapCallback()` function with an empty data parameter. This would cause the `atomicSwapCallback()` function to revert, which would disrupt the operation of the smart contract.
- The attacker could also use the vulnerability to prevent the taker from receiving the quote token. The attacker could do this by creating a malicious contract that implements the `IERC20Taker` interface and does not actually swap the collateral for the quote token. When the taker calls the `atomicSwapCallback()` function, the malicious contract would revert, which would prevent the taker from receiving the quote token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding a check for an empty data parameter to the `atomicSwapCallback()` function.
