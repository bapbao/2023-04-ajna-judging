# addQuoteToken function does not handle cases where the bucket becomes insolvent between transactions

## Summary
The addQuoteToken  function does not explicitly check if the bucket is insolvent at the time of the transaction. Instead, it assumes that the bucket is still solvent and proceeds with the addition of quote tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in addQuoteToken arises when the bucket becomes insolvent between the steps of checking the bankruptcy time and adding the unscaled amount to the deposit. If the bucket becomes insolvent before the unscaled amount is added, the lender's deposit will not be adjusted accordingly, leading to an incorrect balance. This can also lead to a potential exploit where users can add quote tokens to an insolvent bucket, causing an imbalance and potentially disrupting the functioning of the lending pool.
## Impact
The addQuoteToken inability to handle insolvency between transaction will lead to  loss of funds for the lender since the bucket may not be able to honor withdrawals or collateral claims. The lender may not be able to withdraw their funds or claim collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add logic that checks the bankruptcy or insolvent status of the bucket before performing the token move. This could be done by adding a check before updating the bucket LP and emitting the AddQuoteToken event.
