# Precision Loss #3

## Summary
In `_transferCollateralFrom`, the `amount_` parameter is scaled down to the collateral precision before transferring the tokens. This scaling is done using the  `_getArgUint256(COLLATERAL_SCALE)` value. If the scaling factor is not properly accounted for, it can introduce a precision loss or rounding error, leading to incorrect transfer amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In this function, the `amount_` is divided by the value obtained from `_getArgUint256(COLLATERAL_SCALE)`. If the divisor is not an exact multiple of the dividend, a rounding error can occur during the division, leading to a loss of precision. The division operation performed on an `uint256` value will result in a truncated integer value, discarding any fractional part.

For example, if `amount_` is 100 and `_getArgUint256(COLLATERAL_SCALE)` is 3, the result of the division will be 33 (100 / 3 = 33.3333...). The fractional part is discarded, resulting in a loss of precision.
## Impact
The vulnerability can lead to a loss of precision during the division operation, resulting in potential rounding errors and inaccurate token transfers. This can impact the correctness of calculations involving fractional values and may result in incorrect token balances or unexpected behavior.

## POC
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CollateralTransfer {
    uint256 public COLLATERAL_SCALE = 3;

    function _transferCollateral(address to_, uint256 amount_) internal {
        uint256 transferredAmount = amount_ / COLLATERAL_SCALE;
        // Emulate the transfer
        // In this POC, we assume the IERC20 contract is not implemented for simplicity
        // Instead, we'll emit an event to simulate the transfer
        emit Transfer(to_, transferredAmount);
    }

    event Transfer(address to, uint256 amount);
}

contract Attacker {
    CollateralTransfer public collateralTransfer;
    
    constructor(address _collateralTransfer) {
        collateralTransfer = CollateralTransfer(_collateralTransfer);
    }
    
    function exploit() external {
        uint256 amount = 100;
        // Perform the transfer with a non-multiple divisor
        collateralTransfer._transferCollateral(address(this), amount);
    }
    
    // Event listener to capture the transferred amount
    event Transfer(address to, uint256 amount);
    
    // Callback function to receive the transfer event
    function onTransfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        // The transferred amount will be incorrect due to precision loss
        emit Transfer(to, amount);
    }
}

```
In this POC, we have two contracts: CollateralTransfer and Attacker.

The CollateralTransfer contract represents the contract containing the `_transferCollateral` function with the precision loss vulnerability. The `transferredAmount` is obtained by dividing `amount_` by `COLLATERAL_SCALE`, which is assumed to be a value that is not an exact divisor of amount_.

The Attacker contract demonstrates the exploitation of the precision loss vulnerability. It interacts with the `CollateralTransfer` contract by calling the `_transferCollateral` function with a specific amount that triggers the precision loss. The Attacker contract has an event listener, `onTransfer`, which receives the event emitted by `CollateralTransfer` to capture the transferred amount.

To test the POC, deploy both contracts and execute the exploit function in the Attacker contract. The `onTransfer` event will be emitted, showing the incorrect transferred amount due to precision loss.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Use fixed-point arithmetic libraries: Consider utilizing well-tested fixed-point arithmetic libraries that handle decimals and precision accurately. These libraries can provide reliable division operations without the risk of precision loss.
2. Consistent precision scaling: Ensure that all calculations involving decimals or fractional values are consistently scaled to the desired precision. Avoid mixing different precisions in calculations to minimize precision-related issues. Take care to handle rounding errors appropriately.
