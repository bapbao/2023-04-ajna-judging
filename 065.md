# Malicious actor can steal collaterals from any bucket index because the  mergeOrRemoveCollateral() function misses the ownerOf check on the NFTs

## Summary
There should be ownerOf check on functions that transfer NFTs

## Vulnerability Detail
There should be checks to ensure that the caller/ msg.sender is the owner of the NFTs to withdraw as collateral from the provided list of bucket indices in the mergeOrRemoveCollateral() function.

Since the mergeOrRemoveCollateral() function allows claiming NFT collateral across multiple buckets there should be a ownerOf check to ensure that NFTs being withdrawn belongs to the caller.

## Impact
A Malicious actor can steal NFT collaterals from any bucket index.
