# Conflicting Burn Mechanisms

## Summary
The Ajna token has conflicting method which could potentially ruin the accounting mechanism adopted by the protocol.
The ```AjnaToken.sol``` implements the ```ERC20Burnable``` as well as a seperately ```BurnWrappedAjna```
## Vulnerability Detail
The AjnaToken already implements burnability of tokens by the owner or an approved address. This burns the Tokens and reduces the total supply.
The  BurnWrappedAjna however implements a burnable wrapper for ajna, which locks the tokens deposited in the contract forever . See 
```solidity
    function withdrawTo(address, uint256) public pure override returns (bool) {
        revert UnwrapNotAllowed();
    }
```
It also mints a burnWrapped token for the protocol when tokens are deposited.
But Ajna tokens in this contract can never be burnt (Only the wrapped tokens can be burnt), therefore BurnWrapping your tokens do not decrease the ajna token total supply.
## Impact
This leads to conflicting TVLs, token permanently locked and other unintended outcomes
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/token/AjnaToken.sol#L11-L15
```ERC20Burnable.sol``` we have
```solidity
abstract contract ERC20Burnable is Context, ERC20 {
    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller.
     *
     * See {ERC20-_burn}.
     */
    function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, deducting from the caller's
     * allowance.
     *
     * See {ERC20-_burn} and {ERC20-allowance}.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - the caller must have allowance for ``accounts``'s tokens of at least
     * `amount`.
     */
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
```
