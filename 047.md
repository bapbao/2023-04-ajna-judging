# `take` function does not work due to missing approvals

## Summary
take function does not work due to missing approvals 

## Vulnerability Detail
calls to the `take` function will fail because there is an approval missing to transfer the NFT:

 If you check the Open Zeppekin implementation:

you can see that when calling transferFrom, it is required an approval before hand to actually transfer the NFT.
## Impact

Unable to call the `take` function for tokens which are not approved
