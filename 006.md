# `SCREENING_PERIOD_LENGTH` will be less than 73 days on some chains

## Summary
blockTime can be shorter on some L2's.

## Vulnerability Detail
like in optimism 1 block = 2 secs, Bsc 1 block = 3 secs, Avalanche doesn't even have a block time e.t.c

The hardcoded screening period length won't be same on all chains. 
```solidity
uint256 internal constant SCREENING_PERIOD_LENGTH = 525_600;
```
This will affect the `screeningVote()` function which calls _getFundingStageEndBlock() in an if statement to check if screening stage is active because since the Length of the screening stage of the distribution period in blocks can mean something else on some L2 chains, this if statement will have this `_getScreeningStageEndBlock(startBlock)` return values < 73 days.

So when users call the screeningVote() function even tho it's within the  73 days of screening stage of the distribution period, the function will revert on some L2 chains because of this part of the if statement `  ||
            block.number > _getScreeningStageEndBlock(startBlock)
        ) revert InvalidVote();
`
## Impact
users won't be able to call `screeningVote()` function  even tho it's within the 73 days of screening stage of the distribution period on some L2 chains.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
maybe look for a more effective way to check if the screening stage is active, avoid block Numbers as it's NOT a reliable source of timing information for multichain projects
