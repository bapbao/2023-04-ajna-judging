# `GrantFund._state` returns the wrong state

## Summary

The mechanism of `GrantFund` has changed a lot after audits. The layout of each phase in a funding cycle also changed. But the `GrantFund._state` is not changed. That makes `GrantFund._state` return the wrong state.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the previous version, the layout of each phase is:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L186
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L175
```solidity
| screening stage (80 days) | funding stage (10 days)|| DistributionEndBlock ||  challenge stage (7 days)|
```

And the new layout of a funding cycle is:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/GrantFund.sol#L117
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/GrantFund.sol#L128
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/Storage.sol#L42
```solidity
| screening stage (73 days) | funding stage (10 days) |  challenge stage (7 days) || DistributionEndBlock ||
```

One of changes is that `DistributionEndBlock` is now placed at the end of the challenge stage.


However,  `GrantFund._state` has the same logic as `StandardFunding._standardProposalState`. They both use `_distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock > block.number` to determine if the state of the proposal is active or not.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/GrantFund.sol#L496
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/main/ajna-grants/src/grants/base/StandardFunding.sol#L505
```solidity

    function _state(uint256 proposalId_) internal view returns (ProposalState) {
        Proposal memory proposal = _proposals[proposalId_];

        if (proposal.executed)                                                    return ProposalState.Executed;
        else if (_distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock > block.number) return ProposalState.Active;
        else if (_isProposalFinalized(proposalId_))                              return ProposalState.Succeeded;
        else                                                                      return ProposalState.Defeated;
    }


    function _standardProposalState(uint256 proposalId_) internal view returns (ProposalState) {
        Proposal memory proposal = _standardFundingProposals[proposalId_];

        if (proposal.executed)                                                     return ProposalState.Executed;
        else if (_distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock >= block.number) return ProposalState.Active;
        else if (_standardFundingVoteSucceeded(proposalId_))                      return ProposalState.Succeeded;
        else                                                                       return ProposalState.Defeated;
    }
```


Therefore, `GrantFund._state` could return the wrong state.  For example, a proposalâ€™s state should be `ProposalState.Succeeded` during the challenge stage if it is in its distribution period's top funded slate of proposals. But `GrantFund._state` returns `ProposalState.Active` since the challenge stage is now behind `DistributionEndBlock`. However, `ProposalState.Active` in `_standardProposalState` means that the proposal is in the screening stage or the funding stage.


## Impact

If `GrantFund._state` returns the wrong state, users and other protocols get confused. Especially, the projects that want to be funded may use `GrantFund.state` to check the status of their proposals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`GrantFund._state` should return `ProposalState.Active` if the proposal is in the screening stage or the funding stage.
```diff
    function _state(uint256 proposalId_) internal view returns (ProposalState) {
        Proposal memory proposal = _proposals[proposalId_];

        if (proposal.executed)                                                    return ProposalState.Executed;
-       else if (_distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock > block.number) return ProposalState.Active;
+       else if (_distributions[proposal.distributionId].endBlock - CHALLENGE_PERIOD_LENGTH > block.number) return ProposalState.Active;
        else if (_isProposalFinalized(proposalId_))                              return ProposalState.Succeeded;
        else                                                                      return ProposalState.Defeated;
    }
```
