# collateralReceiver can be address(this) in ERC721Pool.sol

## Summary

When the user calls repayDebt() function, he can specify address(this) as the collateralReceiver

## Vulnerability Detail

In ERC721Pool.sol, there is repayDebt() function with borrowerAddress and collateralReceiver parameters that are user-facing. Therefore user can specify address(this) as collateralReceiver and disrupt pool calculations regarding pool.collateral as they are implemented before the actual collateral transfer

## Impact

Medium as pool collateral will be calculated incorrectly and with wrong actual amount

## Code Snippet
