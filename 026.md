# XO-`stampLoan()` function does not require `msg.sender` to be the `owner` of the `loan`.

## Summary
- The vulnerability  is in the function `stampLoan().` The function does not require the `msg.sender` to be the owner of the loan. This means that any attacker could call the function and `restamp` the Neutral Price of any loan, regardless of whether they own the loan or not.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/**
     *  @notice Called by fully colalteralized borrowers to restamp the `Neutral Price` of the loan (only if loan is fully collateralized and not in auction).
     *          The reason for stamping the neutral price on the loan is to provide some certainty to the borrower as to at what price they can expect to be liquidated.
     *          This action can restamp only the loan of `msg.sender`.
     */
    function stampLoan() external;

}
```
- There is a vulnerability is present in  the  function `stampLoan(),` the problem in the function is that the `signature` is does not `require` the `msg.sender` to be the `owner` of the `loan.` This means that any attacker could call the function and `restamp` the `Neutral` Price of any `loan,` regardless of whether they own the `loan` or not.
This vulnerability, it allow an attacker to manipulate the `Neutral` Price of a `loan` and make it more difficult for the borrower to be `liquidated.`
## Impact
- An attacker can calls the stampLoan() function on the loan, and manipulates the Neutral Price of the loan. The borrower is now more likely to be liquidated, and the attacker makes a profit.
- An example :
   - an attacker creates a new `borrower.`
   - The attacker creates a loan for the new `borrower.`
   - The attacker calls the `stampLoan()` function on the loan, even though they do not own the loan.
   - The attacker manipulates the `Neutral` Price of the loan.
   - The borrower is now more likely to be liquidated.
   - The attacker makes a profit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- add a `require` statement to the function that checks if the `msg.sender` is the `owner` of the `loan.` this change is going to ensure that the `msg.sender` is the `owner` of the `loan` before they can call the `stampLoan()` function.
