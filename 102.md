# Users can earn more rewards than they should, due to rounding error

## Summary

When unstaking, the interest earned can potentially be rounded in favor of the user, and a user can manipulate the rounding behavior so that they are being favored and earn more interest than they should.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `RewardsManager.unstake()`, the function `RewardsManager._unstake()` is called:

Then `_calculateAndClaimAllRewards()` is called:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L780

Then `_calculateAndClaimStakingRewards()` is called:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L528

Then `_calculateNextEpochRewards` is called:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L348

Then `_calculateExchangeRateInterestEarned` is called:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/RewardsManager.sol#L408

There `interestEarned_` is calculated by using the `Maths.wmul` function. `Maths.wmul()` is rounding up or down to the nearest `WAD = 10**18`, sometimes rounding in favor of, and sometimes against the user. Since the user controls one of the input variables for the multiplication in `Maths.wmul()`, which is the `bucketLP_`, the user can control the rounding behaviour in `Maths.wmul()` to round in favor of the user.

## Impact

- The rounding of the earned rewards for a user, who is unstaking, can be manipulated by the user, in favor of the user. Thus a user earns more rewards than they should earn, which can be exploited.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rounding inside `RewardsManager._calculateExchangeRateInterestEarned()` should be against the user to avoid exploits.
